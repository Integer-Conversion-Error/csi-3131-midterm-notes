\section{Summary}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Deadlock: set of processes, each waiting for event caused by another process in set.
    \item Four necessary conditions for deadlock:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Mutual exclusion.
        \item Hold and wait.
        \item No preemption.
        \item Circular wait.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Deadlock only possible if all four conditions present.
    \item Deadlocks modeled with resource-allocation graphs; cycle indicates deadlock.
    \item Deadlock prevention: ensure one of four conditions cannot occur.
    \item Practical prevention: eliminate circular wait.
    \item Deadlock avoidance: use banker's algorithm; don't grant resources if leads to unsafe state.
    \item Deadlock detection: algorithm evaluates processes/resources on running system to find deadlocked state.
    \item Deadlock recovery:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Abort one process in circular wait.
        \item Preempt resources assigned to deadlocked process.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
