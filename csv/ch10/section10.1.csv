How does virtual memory primarily benefit programmers regarding memory limitations?,It forces programmers to manually manage physical memory addresses.,It restricts programmers to writing smaller programs.,It frees programmers from physical memory-storage limitations.,It increases the complexity of memory allocation for programmers.,It requires programs to be written in assembly language.,C,"The text states, ""Frees programmers from memory-storage limitations"" and ""Simplifies programming: no worry about physical memory limits."""
How does virtual memory contribute to increased CPU utilization and throughput?,By requiring more physical memory per program.,By decreasing the number of programs run concurrently.,"By allowing less physical memory per program, thus running more programs concurrently.",By increasing response and turnaround time.,By eliminating the need for context switching.,C,"The text explains, ""Less physical memory per program \u2192 more programs run concurrently \u2192 increased CPU utilization and throughput (no increase in response/turnaround time)."""
"One benefit of partial program execution in memory, facilitated by virtual memory, is its effect on I/O and program speed.

What was the primary limitation of traditional memory management techniques before virtual memory?,Inability to run multiple programs simultaneously.,Programs were limited in size by the available physical memory.,It required complex hardware for memory allocation.,It could only manage read-only memory.,It prevented any form of shared memory.,B,"The text states under ""Background"" that ""Limitation: program size limited by physical memory."""
Which of the following is cited as a reason why real programs often do not need their entire code in physical memory?,Core program logic is always kept in cache memory.,All program options are used in every execution.,Error handling code is seldom executed.,Arrays and lists are always allocated the exact memory they need.,Programmers intentionally write redundant code.,C,"The text lists ""Error handling code: seldom executed"" as one reason why entire program code is not always needed."
"According to the provided text, what is the definition of a ""virtual address space""?",The physical memory available on the system.,The cache memory used by the CPU.,A logical view of how a process is stored in memory.,The total amount of disk space allocated for paging.,The address space used by the operating system kernel only.,C,"The text and glossary define ""virtual address space"" as ""Logical view of how a process is stored in memory."""
What is the primary function of the Memory-Management Unit (MMU) in the context of virtual memory?,To manage the growth of the heap and stack.,To map logical pages to physical page frames.,To directly store program instructions.,To determine the size of the virtual address space.,To allocate physical memory contiguously for all processes.,B,"The text states, ""Memory-management unit (MMU): maps logical pages to physical page frames."""
"What best describes a ""sparse"" address space?",An address space where all memory is contiguous and fully utilized.,An address space that is smaller than the physical memory.,An address space with many holes or unused regions.,An address space reserved exclusively for system libraries.,An address space that only supports read-only access.,C,"The glossary defines ""sparse"" as ""an address space with many holes,"" and the text notes ""Sparse address spaces: virtual address spaces with holes."""
One benefit of sparse address spaces is the facilitation of what process?,Static linking of all libraries at compile time.,Reducing the total size of physical memory required for the system.,Dynamic linking of libraries/shared objects during execution.,Ensuring all parts of a program are loaded into memory simultaneously.,Preventing any form of memory sharing between processes.,C,"The text lists ""Dynamic linking of libraries/shared objects during execution"" as a benefit of sparse address spaces."
How does virtual memory enable processes to share system libraries like the standard C library?,By duplicating the library code for each process.,"By loading libraries into a dedicated, non-sharable memory region.","By mapping the libraries into the virtual address space of processes, often read-only, sharing physical pages.",By forcing processes to include the library code directly in their executable.,By making libraries accessible only to the operating system kernel.,C,"The text states, ""System libraries (e.g., standard C library) shared by mapping into virtual address space. Libraries mapped read-only, physical pages shared by processes."""
"How does virtual memory contribute to speeding up process creation, particularly with operations like `fork()`?",By requiring complete duplication of all memory pages.,By preventing memory sharing during creation.,By enabling pages to be shared between parent and child processes.,"By using a slower, more deliberate copying mechanism.",By eliminating the need for a memory management unit.,C,"The text states, ""Pages shared during process creation (fork()) \u2192 speeds up process creation."""
Which of the following is an accurate statement about the impact of virtual memory on system performance?,It always decreases CPU utilization because of increased overhead.,It can increase CPU utilization and throughput by allowing more programs to run concurrently.,It leads to an increase in response and turnaround time for programs.,It eliminates the need for context switching between processes.,It only benefits single-process systems.,B,"The text explicitly states, ""Less physical memory per program \u2192 more programs run concurrently \u2192 increased CPU utilization and throughput (no increase in response/turnaround time)."""
Virtual memory abstracts main memory into what kind of storage structure?,"A small, fixed-size cache.","A fragmented, discontinuous block.","A large, uniform storage array.","A temporary, volatile disk space.","A hardware-specific, non-abstracted region.",C,"The text says virtual memory ""Abstracts main memory into large, uniform storage array."""
