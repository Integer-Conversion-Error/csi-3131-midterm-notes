What is virtual memory?,A technique allowing execution of a process not completely in memory; it separates logical memory from physical memory.
What is a major advantage of virtual memory?,It allows programs to be larger than the physical memory available.
How does virtual memory abstract main memory?,"It abstracts main memory into a large, uniform storage array."
What is the relationship between logical and physical memory in virtual memory systems?,Virtual memory separates logical memory (the programmer's view) from physical memory.
How does virtual memory benefit programmers?,It frees programmers from memory-storage limitations and simplifies programming by removing worries about physical memory limits.
What sharing capabilities does virtual memory enable for processes?,"It allows processes to share files, libraries, and implement shared memory."
How does virtual memory impact process creation?,"It provides an efficient mechanism for process creation, including sharing pages during process creation (fork())."
What are potential drawbacks or considerations for virtual memory implementation?,Its implementation is complex and can decrease performance if used carelessly.
How did traditional memory management differ from virtual memory regarding process execution?,Traditional memory management required the entire process to be in physical memory for execution.
What was a limitation of traditional memory management regarding program size?,Program size was limited by the physical memory available.
Why do real programs often not need their entire code in memory?,"They may contain error handling code (seldom executed), arrays/lists allocated more memory than needed, or rare program options/features that are rarely used."
What are the benefits of executing only partial programs in memory?,"1. Programs are not constrained by physical memory size, allowing for a large virtual address space.
2. Less physical memory is needed per program, allowing more programs to run concurrently, increasing CPU utilization and throughput (without increasing response/turnaround time).
3. Less I/O is required for loading/swapping, leading to faster program execution."
What is a virtual address space?,It is the logical view of how a process is stored in memory.
How is a process's storage typically viewed in its virtual address space?,It typically starts at logical address 0 with contiguous memory.
How is physical memory organized in relation to logical pages?,"Physical memory is organized in page frames, which are not necessarily contiguous."
What is the function of the Memory-Management Unit (MMU) in virtual memory?,It maps logical pages to physical page frames.
How do the heap and stack grow within a virtual address space?,"The heap grows upward, and the stack grows downward."
What is the purpose of the large blank space typically found between the heap and stack in a virtual address space?,This space is part of the virtual address space but only requires physical pages if the heap or stack grows into it.
"What are ""sparse"" address spaces?","Virtual address spaces with holes; describes a page table with noncontiguous, scattered entries or an address space with many holes."
What are the benefits of sparse address spaces?,"1. Holes can be filled as the stack or heap grows.
2. They facilitate dynamic linking of libraries/shared objects during execution."
How does virtual memory enable sharing of system libraries?,"System libraries (e.g., standard C library) are shared by mapping them into the virtual address space, typically as read-only, with physical pages shared by multiple processes."
How do processes use virtual memory for communication?,Processes can share memory regions for communication.
