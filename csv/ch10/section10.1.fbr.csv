What is virtual memory?,A technique allowing execution of a process not completely in memory; it separates logical memory from physical memory.,y
What is the major advantage of virtual memory?,It allows programs to be larger than physical memory.,y
How does virtual memory abstract main memory?,"Into a large, uniform storage array.",y
What two types of memory does virtual memory separate?,Logical memory (programmer's view) from physical memory.,y
What benefit does virtual memory provide to programmers regarding memory constraints?,"It frees programmers from memory-storage limitations, allowing them not to worry about physical memory limits.",y
"Beyond basic execution, what capabilities does virtual memory allow processes to do?","Share files, libraries, and implement shared memory.",y
What is the impact of virtual memory on process creation?,It provides an efficient mechanism for process creation.,y
What is a potential downside of virtual memory implementation?,It can be complex and decrease performance if used carelessly.,y
What was the primary limitation of traditional memory management?,"The entire process had to be in physical memory for execution, limiting program size to physical memory.",y
Why do real programs often not need their entire code loaded into memory?,"Because parts like error handling code are seldom executed, arrays/lists are often allocated more memory than needed, and rare program options/features are rarely used.",y
"List the benefits of executing only parts of a program in memory (i.e., using virtual memory).","1. Programs are not constrained by physical memory size, allowing for a large virtual address space. 2. Less physical memory is required per program, leading to more programs running concurrently, which increases CPU utilization and throughput (without increasing response/turnaround time). 3. Less I/O is needed for loading/swapping, resulting in faster program execution.",y
Define 'virtual address space'.,A logical view of how a process is stored in memory. It typically presents the process as starting at logical address 0 with contiguous memory.,y
How is physical memory organized when using virtual memory?,"In page frames, which are not necessarily contiguous.",y
What is the function of the Memory-Management Unit (MMU)?,It maps logical pages to physical page frames.,y
How do the heap and stack typically grow within a process's virtual address space?,"The heap grows upward, and the stack grows downward.",y
What is the significance of the large blank space often found between the heap and stack in a virtual address space?,It is part of the virtual address space but only requires physical pages if the heap or stack grows into it.,y
What does it mean for an address space to be 'sparse'?,"It describes an address space with many 'holes' or a page table with noncontiguous, scattered entries.",y
What are the benefits of sparse address spaces?,1. Holes can be filled as the stack or heap grows. 2. They facilitate dynamic linking of libraries or shared objects during execution.,y
"How does virtual memory allow system libraries (e.g., standard C library) to be shared by multiple processes?","By mapping them into the virtual address space of processes. These libraries are typically mapped read-only, allowing their physical pages to be shared among processes.",y
How does virtual memory enable inter-process communication?,Processes can share memory regions for communication.,y
"How does virtual memory speed up process creation, particularly with `fork()`?",By allowing pages to be shared between the parent and child process initially.,y
