Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
Which virtual memory management technique does Linux primarily use?,Segmentation,Swapping,Demand paging,Static partitioning,Overlaying,C,"Linux manages virtual memory using demand paging, which brings pages into memory only when they are needed."
What kind of page-replacement policy does Linux implement?,Local LRU,FIFO,Optimal,Global LRU-approximation clock algorithm (second-chance),Most Recently Used (MRU),D,"Linux uses a global page-replacement policy similar to the LRU-approximation clock algorithm, also known as second-chance."
Linux maintains two page lists for memory management. What are they called?,Allocated and Deallocated,In-use and Free,Active and Inactive,Primary and Secondary,Resident and Swapped,C,Linux maintains an `active_list` for pages considered in use and an `inactive_list` for pages not recently referenced and eligible for reclamation.
"In Linux, what happens when a page in the `inactive_list` is referenced?",Its accessed bit is reset.,It is immediately reclaimed for the free list.,It moves back to the rear of the `active_list`.,It is written to secondary storage.,It remains in the `inactive_list` until reclaimed by kswapd.,C,"If a page in the `inactive_list` is referenced, it moves back to the rear of the `active_list`, indicating it is now in use."
Which daemon process in the Linux kernel is responsible for managing free memory and reclaiming pages?,pageservd,memmgrd,kswapd,pagedaemon,freememd,C,"The Linux kernel's page-out daemon process, `kswapd`, periodically awakens to check free memory and reclaims pages from the `inactive_list` if free memory falls below a threshold."
When does the Linux `kswapd` process typically scan the `inactive_list` to reclaim pages?,When the `active_list` becomes empty.,When a new process is created.,If free memory falls below a predetermined threshold.,"Every 5 seconds, regardless of memory status.",Only when the system is booting up.,C,`kswapd` scans the `inactive_list` and reclaims pages for the free list if free memory falls below a specific threshold.
What is the primary function of the `accessed` bit for pages in Linux's virtual memory management?,To indicate if a page is dirty and needs to be written to disk.,To track the total number of times a page has been referenced.,To determine if a page has been recently referenced for page replacement.,To signify that a page is currently being used by the kernel.,To mark a page as read-only.,C,The `accessed` bit is set when a page is referenced and is used by the LRU-approximation algorithm to determine which pages are least recently used and thus eligible for reclamation.

When does Windows perform a local LRU page replacement policy?,Only when the system boots up.,When a process is at its working-set maximum and there is insufficient free memory.,When a process is below its working-set minimum.,When `automatic working-set trimming` is active.,When the `hard working-set limits` are ignored.,B,"If a process is at its working-set maximum and there is insufficient free memory, the kernel selects a page from that process's working set for replacement using a local LRU policy."
Which of the following virtual memory features is NOT explicitly mentioned as implemented by Windows?,Demand paging,Copy-on-write,Memory compression,"First-In, First-Out (FIFO) page replacement",Shared libraries,D,"Windows implements demand paging, copy-on-write, paging, memory compression, and shared libraries. Its page replacement is an LRU-approximation clock algorithm (second-chance), not FIFO."
"In Solaris, what is the role of the `lotsfree` parameter?",It defines the maximum amount of physical memory available.,It is the threshold for Solaris to begin paging activities.,It specifies the number of pages to scan per second.,It determines the desired free memory level.,It represents the number of pages reclaimed by `kswapd`.,B,"`lotsfree` is a parameter in Solaris that serves as a threshold; if free pages fall below this value, the pageout process starts."
How often does the Solaris kernel check free memory against the `lotsfree` parameter?,Once per second,Twice per second,Four times per second,Every 30 seconds,Only when a page fault occurs,C,The Solaris kernel checks free memory against `lotsfree` four times per second.
