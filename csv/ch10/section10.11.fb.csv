Define Virtual Memory.,Abstracts physical memory into an extremely large uniform array of storage.
What is a benefit of virtual memory regarding program size?,A program can be larger than physical memory.
What is a benefit of virtual memory regarding a program's entire presence in memory?,A program does not need to be entirely in memory.
What is a benefit of virtual memory regarding process memory sharing?,Processes can share memory.
What is a benefit of virtual memory regarding process creation?,Processes can be created more efficiently.
What is Demand Paging?,Pages are loaded only when demanded during program execution.
What happens to pages never demanded in a demand paging system?,Pages never demanded are never loaded.
What is a Page Fault?,Occurs when a page not in memory is accessed.
What action is required when a page fault occurs?,The page must be brought from the backing store into an available page frame.
Explain Copy-on-write.,A mechanism where a child process shares the same address space as its parent.
What happens in Copy-on-write if a child or parent modifies a page?,A copy of the page is made.
When is a page-replacement algorithm used?,"When available memory is low, it selects an existing page to replace."
Name common page-replacement algorithms.,"FIFO, optimal, LRU."
Why is pure LRU impractical to implement?,It is impractical to implement; most systems use LRU-approximation algorithms.
Define Global page-replacement algorithms.,Algorithms that select a page from any process for replacement.
Define Local page-replacement algorithms.,Algorithms that select a page from the faulting process for replacement.
What is Thrashing?,A state where the system spends more time paging than executing.
Define Locality in memory management.,A set of pages actively used together.
How does process execution relate to locality?,Process execution moves from locality to locality.
What is a Working Set?,"Based on locality, it is the set of pages currently in use by a process."
What is Memory Compression?,A technique that compresses a number of pages into a single page.
When is memory compression used as an alternative to paging?,On mobile systems without paging support.
How is Kernel memory allocated differently than user-mode processes?,It is allocated in contiguous chunks of varying sizes.
Name two common techniques for kernel memory allocation.,Buddy system and Slab allocation.
What is TLB reach?,The amount of memory accessible from the TLB (Translation Lookaside Buffer).
How is TLB reach calculated?,Equal to the number of entries in TLB multiplied by the page size (Number of entries in TLB Ã— page size).
What is a technique to increase TLB reach?,Increase page size.
"How do Linux, Windows, and Solaris manage virtual memory?","They manage it similarly, using demand paging, copy-on-write, and variations of LRU approximation (clock algorithm)."
