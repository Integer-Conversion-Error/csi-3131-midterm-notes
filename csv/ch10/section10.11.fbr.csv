What is virtual memory?,Abstracts physical memory into an extremely large uniform array of storage.,y
Name one benefit of virtual memory related to program size.,Program can be larger than physical memory.,y
Name one benefit of virtual memory related to program loading.,Program does not need to be entirely in memory.,y
Name one benefit of virtual memory related to process interaction.,Processes can share memory.,y
Name one benefit of virtual memory related to process creation.,Processes can be created more efficiently.,y
Define Demand paging.,Pages are loaded only when demanded during program execution.,y
"In demand paging, what happens to pages that are never demanded?",Pages never demanded are never loaded.,y
What is a page fault?,Occurs when a page not in memory is accessed.,y
What action must be taken when a page fault occurs?,The page must be brought from the backing store into an available page frame.,y
Define Copy-on-write.,A mechanism where a child process shares the same address space as its parent.,y
Under what condition is a copy of a page made in a copy-on-write system?,If the child or parent modifies the shared page.,y
When are page-replacement algorithms used?,"When available memory is low, a page-replacement algorithm selects an existing page to replace.",y
Name common page-replacement algorithms.,"FIFO, optimal, LRU.",y
Why is pure LRU impractical to implement?,Most systems use LRU-approximation algorithms instead.,y
Define Global page-replacement algorithms.,Algorithms that select a page from any process for replacement.,y
Define Local page-replacement algorithms.,Algorithms that select a page only from the faulting process for replacement.,y
What is Thrashing?,A state where the system spends more time paging than executing.,y
Define Locality (in the context of memory management).,A set of pages actively used together.,y
How does process execution typically behave with regard to locality?,Process execution moves from locality to locality.,y
What is a Working set?,"Based on locality, it's the set of pages currently in use by a process.",y
What is Memory compression?,A technique that compresses a number of pages into a single page.,y
When is memory compression used as an alternative to paging?,On mobile systems without paging support.,y
How is Kernel memory allocation different from user-mode process memory allocation?,"Kernel memory is allocated differently, in contiguous chunks of varying sizes.",y
Name two common techniques for kernel memory allocation.,Buddy system and Slab allocation.,y
What is TLB reach?,The amount of memory accessible from the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB).,y
How is TLB reach calculated?,Number of entries in TLB Ã— page size.,y
What is a technique to increase TLB reach?,Increase the page size.,y
"How do Linux, Windows, and Solaris manage virtual memory?","They manage it similarly, using demand paging, copy-on-write, and variations of LRU approximation (e.g., clock algorithm).",y
