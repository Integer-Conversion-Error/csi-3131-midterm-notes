Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
What is a primary objective of using copy-on-write (COW) during process creation with `fork()`?,"To ensure the child process always receives a complete, independent copy of the parent's address space.",To maximize the allocation of new pages to the child process immediately after creation.,To minimize the number of new pages allocated to the child process initially.,To prevent the child process from ever modifying any data inherited from the parent.,To bypass demand paging for all pages in the child process.,C,Copy-on-write (COW) is a technique that minimizes new pages allocated to the child process by initially sharing pages with the parent.
How does the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism fundamentally alter the traditional `fork()` behavior?,"Traditionally, `fork()` used a page-sharing mechanism similar to COW, whereas COW copies all pages.","Traditional `fork()` immediately copied the parent's entire address space, while COW initially shares pages.","COW ensures all parent pages are duplicated, while traditional `fork()` only duplicates modified pages.","Traditional `fork()` suspended the parent, which COW does not do.",COW is less efficient than traditional `fork()` for process creation.,B,"Traditionally, `fork()` copied the parent's entire address space for the child. With copy-on-write, the parent and child processes initially share the same pages."
"According to the copy-on-write (COW) technique, what action triggers the copying of a shared page?",When the child process terminates.,When the parent process resumes from suspension.,When either the parent or child process attempts to write to a shared page.,When the operating system runs out of free memory frames.,When an `exec()` call is made by the child process.,C,"If either the parent or child process writes to a shared page that is marked as copy-on-write, a copy of that shared page is created."
Which statement accurately describes how pages are handled under the copy-on-write (COW) mechanism?,"All pages, including executable code, are always copied to the child process.",Only stack pages are initially shared; all other pages are immediately copied.,"Unmodified pages, such as executable code, continue to be shared between parent and child.",Both modified and unmodified pages are always copied to ensure process isolation.,Pages are only copied if the child process modifies them and never if the parent modifies them.,C,"Only modified pages are copied under COW; unmodified pages (e.g., executable code) can continue to be shared between the parent and child processes."
"What is the primary benefit of using copy-on-write (COW) in the context of process creation, especially when the child process might immediately call `exec()`?",It ensures the child process has a completely independent address space from the start.,It increases the complexity of memory management for the operating system.,"It avoids unnecessary copying of memory pages, which might be discarded by `exec()`.",It allows the parent process to continue execution without suspension.,It prioritizes disk I/O over memory operations.,C,"Copying pages may be unnecessary if the child immediately calls `exec()`, as those copied pages would simply be overwritten. COW avoids this wasteful copying."
In which of the following operating systems is the copy-on-write (COW) technique commonly employed for process creation?,MS-DOS,"Windows, Linux, and macOS",Early versions of UNIX only,Only specialized real-time operating systems,Only systems that do not support virtual memory.,B,"Copy-on-write is a common technique used in modern operating systems such as Windows, Linux, and macOS."
What is a defining characteristic of the `vfork()` system call concerning the parent and child processes' address spaces?,The child process receives a completely independent copy of the parent's address space.,The child process uses its own unique address space while the parent's is suspended.,The child process shares the parent's address space directly for read and write operations.,"The child process initially shares pages, but a copy-on-write mechanism is used for modifications.","The parent and child processes share only read-only pages, with separate writable pages.",C,"With `vfork()`, the child process uses the parent's address space directly for read/write operations."
What is a fundamental difference in memory management between `vfork()` and `fork()` using copy-on-write?,"`vfork()` explicitly uses copy-on-write, whereas `fork()` does not.","`vfork()` does not use copy-on-write, and child modifications are visible to the parent, unlike `fork()` with COW.","`fork()` always copies all pages, while `vfork()` only copies modified pages.","`vfork()` allocates new pages for the child process, while `fork()` shares them.","`vfork()` allows concurrent execution of parent and child, while `fork()` suspends the parent.",B,"`vfork()` does not use copy-on-write, which means any changes made by the child to the shared address space are visible to the parent upon resumption. `fork()` with COW, conversely, ensures changes are made to a private copy."
For what specific scenario is the `vfork()` system call primarily intended?,When the child process is expected to perform extensive data processing within the inherited address space.,When the child process needs to create many new threads.,When the child process is intended to immediately call `exec()`.,When the parent process requires concurrent execution with the child without suspension.,When robust memory isolation between parent and child is paramount.,C,"`vfork()` is intended for use when the child process calls `exec()` immediately after its creation, as this avoids unnecessary copying."
What is a critical caution associated with using `vfork()`?,It is significantly slower than `fork()` for process creation.,"The child process might inadvertently modify the parent's address space, with visible effects.",It automatically applies copy-on-write to all shared pages.,It prevents the child process from calling `exec()`.,It is not supported on modern UNIX-like operating systems.,B,"A critical caution when using `vfork()` is that the child must not modify the parent's address space, as any changes made by the child will be visible to the parent upon resumption."
How does `vfork()`'s efficiency compare to other process creation methods?,It is less efficient due to the overhead of parent suspension.,It is extremely efficient due to the absence of page copying.,Its efficiency is comparable to traditional `fork()` with full page copying.,It is only efficient for very small child processes.,Its efficiency is entirely dependent on the amount of data modified by the child.,B,"`vfork()` is described as extremely efficient for process creation because it involves no page copying, unlike traditional `fork()` or even `fork()` with COW when pages are written to."
What happens to the parent process when `vfork()` is called?,The parent process continues execution concurrently with the child.,The parent process is immediately terminated.,The parent process is suspended until the child process completes its execution or calls `exec()`.,"The parent process enters a waiting state, but its address space is duplicated.",The parent process relinquishes its address space to the child.,C,"When `vfork()` is called, the parent process is suspended, and the child process uses the parent's address space directly. The parent typically resumes after the child calls `exec()` or exits."
"According to the provided glossary, which statement best defines 'copy-on-write'?",A mechanism where data is copied then modified upon a write attempt to a shared page.,"A technique where all shared pages are copied immediately upon process creation, then modified.",A system call that allows a child process to share the parent's address space for read/write operations without copying.,An optimization that prevents any page from being copied under any circumstances.,A process creation method that always bypasses demand paging entirely.,A,"The glossary defines 'copy-on-write' as: 'Write causes data to be copied then modified; on shared page write, page copied, write to copy.'"
"Based on the section glossary, what is the correct definition of 'virtual memory fork'?",A system call that duplicates the parent's entire virtual memory space into the child's.,A technique that uses copy-on-write to share virtual memory pages between parent and child processes.,"The `vfork()` system call; child shares parent's address space for read/write, parent suspended.",A method for creating virtual machines that share physical memory.,A process creation method that ensures absolute memory isolation between parent and child.,C,"The glossary defines 'virtual memory fork' as: '`vfork()` system call; child shares parent's address space for read/write, parent suspended.'"
