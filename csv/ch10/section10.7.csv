Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
Memory compression is presented as an alternative to which common memory management technique?,Virtualization,Disk caching,Paging,Segmentation,Multithreading,C,The text states: 'Alternative to paging: memory compression.'
What is the primary method memory compression uses to reduce memory usage?,Swapping frames to disk more frequently,Consolidating multiple frames into a single frame,Increasing the size of individual memory frames,Eliminating the need for a free-frame list,Reducing the number of processes in memory,B,The text explains: 'Compress several frames into a single frame' and 'Reduces memory usage without swapping pages.'
"According to the example, what condition typically triggers memory compression as part of page replacement?",A page fault occurs for a non-resident page,The CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold,The free-frame list drops below a specific threshold,A new process requests a large block of memory,An application explicitly requests memory compression,C,The example states: 'Free-frame list below threshold → triggers page replacement.'
"When frames are selected for compression, what happens instead of writing them to swap space?",They are immediately discarded to free memory,They are marked as read-only and kept in memory,They are compressed and stored within another single page frame,They are moved to a special 'quarantine' area of memory,They are replicated across multiple physical frames for redundancy,C,"The text describes: 'Instead of writing to swap space, compress frames (e.g., three) into single page frame.'"
"After frames like 15, 3, and 35 are compressed and stored into a new frame (e.g., frame 7), what happens to the original frames (15, 3, 35)?",They remain on the modified-frame list,They are permanently deleted from memory,They are moved to the free-frame list,They are immediately swapped out to disk,They are marked as reserved for future use by the compressed data,C,"The example states: 'Frames 15, 3, 35 moved to free-frame list.'"
What action occurs if a compressed frame is referenced by the system?,The system issues a warning to the user,The compressed frame is immediately swapped out,"A page fault occurs, leading to decompression and restoration of original pages",The frame is simply re-compressed into an even smaller size,"The reference is ignored, as the data is not directly accessible",C,"The text explains: 'If compressed frame referenced → page fault, decompressed, restoring original pages.'"
Which mobile operating systems are noted for using memory compression as an integral part of their memory-management strategy due to generally not supporting standard swapping/paging?,Windows Mobile and BlackBerry OS,Android and iOS,Symbian and WebOS,Tizen and Sailfish OS,Ubuntu Touch and Firefox OS,B,"The text states: 'Mobile systems (Android, iOS) generally don't support standard swapping/paging. Memory compression integral to their memory-management strategy.'"
Which of the following desktop operating systems are mentioned as supporting memory compression?,Linux and Chrome OS,FreeBSD and OpenBSD,Windows 7 and macOS (Pre-10.9),Windows 10 and macOS (Version 10.9+),MS-DOS and Windows XP,D,The text explicitly states: 'Windows 10 and macOS support memory compression.'
"On Windows 10, which type of applications are specifically mentioned as candidates for memory compression on mobile devices?",Classic Win32 applications,Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps,Java-based applications,Linux subsystem applications,Legacy .NET Framework applications,B,The text specifies: 'Windows 10: Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps on mobile devices are candidates.'
How does macOS (Version 10.9+) prioritize memory compression relative to paging?,It always pages to SSD before attempting any compression.,It only compresses pages that are actively being used.,"It compresses LRU pages when free memory is short, then pages if needed.",It compresses pages only after all swap space has been exhausted.,It uses memory compression and paging simultaneously with equal priority.,C,"The text states: 'macOS (Version 10.9+): compresses LRU pages when free memory is short, then pages if needed.'"
"According to performance tests on macOS, how does memory compression compare to paging to an SSD?",Memory compression is significantly slower than paging to SSD.,Memory compression and paging to SSD have comparable performance.,Memory compression is faster than paging to SSD.,Memory compression is only faster if the SSD is nearly full.,There is no significant performance difference between the two.,C,The text notes: 'Performance tests: memory compression faster than paging to SSD on macOS.'
What is a requirement for memory compression to store compressed pages?,A dedicated hardware compression unit,Allocating free frames for the compressed data,Pre-existing swap space on a hard drive,Disabling the CPU's caching mechanism,Increasing the total physical RAM in the system,B,The text states: 'Memory compression requires allocating free frames for compressed pages.'
What is the main contention or trade-off in designing memory compression algorithms?,Between data integrity and system stability,Between network bandwidth and CPU cycles,Between compression speed and compression ratio,Between power consumption and memory capacity,Between security vulnerabilities and ease of implementation,C,The text mentions: 'Contention between compression speed and compression ratio (amount of reduction).'
What is generally true about memory compression algorithms that aim for higher compression ratios?,They are typically faster and less computationally expensive.,They are only effective on very small amounts of data.,They tend to be slower and more computationally expensive.,They require specialized hardware found only in servers.,They have no impact on CPU usage or speed.,C,"The text states: 'Higher compression ratios → slower, more computationally expensive algorithms.'"
How can the performance of memory compression be improved using hardware resources?,By increasing the clock speed of the single core,By reducing the total amount of RAM available,By using parallel compression with multiple cores,By offloading compression tasks to the GPU,"By using slower, but more energy-efficient, storage",C,The text indicates: 'Improved by parallel compression using multiple cores.'
Microsoft's Xpress and Apple's WKdm are cited as examples of compression algorithms that balance which two factors?,Security and accessibility,Storage capacity and network latency,High ratios with fast algorithms,Power efficiency and manufacturing cost,Compatibility and proprietary features,C,"The text states these examples 'balance factors: high ratios with fast algorithms' and are 'fast, compress to 30-50% original size.'"
What is the definition of 'compression ratio' as provided in the glossary?,The speed at which data can be compressed.,The amount of memory required to perform compression.,A measurement of compression effectiveness (ratio of compressed to uncompressed space).,The number of frames that can be compressed into one.,The percentage of CPU time spent on compression tasks.,C,The glossary defines 'compression ratio' as 'Measurement of compression effectiveness (ratio of compressed to uncompressed space).'
"What does the acronym 'UWP' stand for, and what is its purpose according to the glossary?",Unified Windows Protocol; a new network communication standard.,Universal Wireless Power; a technology for wireless charging.,Unique Workstation Platform; a system for specialized workstations.,Universal Windows Platform; Windows 10 architecture providing common app platform for all devices running it.,Underlying Web Portal; a framework for web-based applications.,D,The glossary defines 'Universal Windows Platform (UWP)' as 'Windows 10 architecture providing common app platform for all devices running it.'
What is the estimated typical compression ratio achieved by fast algorithms like Microsoft's Xpress and Apple's WKdm?,5-10% of original size,15-25% of original size,30-50% of original size,60-75% of original size,80-95% of original size,C,"The text mentions: 'Examples: Microsoft's Xpress, Apple's WKdm → fast, compress to 30-50% original size.'"
