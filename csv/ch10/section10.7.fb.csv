What is memory compression an alternative to?,Paging.
Define memory compression.,An alternative to paging; compresses frame contents to decrease memory usage.
How does memory compression reduce memory usage?,"It compresses several frames into a single frame, reducing memory usage without swapping pages."
What is a primary benefit of memory compression?,It reduces memory usage without swapping pages.
"What triggers page replacement in the context of memory compression (e.g., Figure 10.7.1)?",The free-frame list falling below a certain threshold.
"After page replacement is triggered in memory compression (e.g., Figure 10.7.1), what happens to selected frames (e.g., 15, 3, 35, 26)?",They are placed on a modified-frame list.
"In memory compression (e.g., Figure 10.7.1), what is done with frames on the modified-frame list instead of writing them to swap space?","They are compressed (e.g., three frames) into a single page frame."
"In the memory compression process (e.g., Figure 10.7.2), which type of frame is typically removed from the free-frame list to store compressed data?","A frame (e.g., Frame 7)."
"Where are compressed frames (e.g., 15, 3, 35) stored after compression in the memory compression process (e.g., Figure 10.7.2)?","In a single frame (e.g., Frame 7), which is then stored in a list of compressed frames."
"What happens to the original frames (e.g., 15, 3, 35) after their contents are compressed into another frame?",They are moved to the free-frame list.
What happens if a compressed frame is referenced?,"A page fault occurs, the frame is decompressed, and the original pages are restored."
"Do mobile systems (Android, iOS) typically support standard swapping/paging?","No, they generally do not."
"What is integral to the memory-management strategy of mobile systems (Android, iOS)?",Memory compression.
Which desktop operating systems support memory compression?,Windows 10 and macOS.
Which type of applications are candidates for memory compression on Windows 10 mobile devices?,Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.
Define Universal Windows Platform (UWP).,Windows 10 architecture providing a common app platform for all devices running it.
How does macOS (Version 10.9+) utilize memory compression?,"It compresses LRU (Least Recently Used) pages when free memory is short, then pages if needed."
How does memory compression performance compare to paging to SSD on macOS?,Memory compression is faster than paging to SSD on macOS.
What does memory compression require for storing compressed pages?,Allocating free frames.
What is an example of significant memory saving possible with memory compression?,Compressing 3 frames into 1.
What are the two main factors that have contention in memory compression?,Compression speed and compression ratio.
Define compression ratio.,A measurement of compression effectiveness (ratio of compressed to uncompressed space).
What is the relationship between higher compression ratios and algorithm characteristics?,"Higher compression ratios typically require slower, more computationally expensive algorithms."
What do most memory compression algorithms aim to balance?,High compression ratios with fast algorithms.
How can memory compression performance be improved?,By parallel compression using multiple cores.
Name two examples of fast memory compression algorithms/implementations and their typical compression performance.,"Microsoft's Xpress and Apple's WKdm, which compress to 30-50% of the original size."
