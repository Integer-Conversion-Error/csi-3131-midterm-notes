What are the benefits of utility storage?,"It reduces the drives needed by hosts initially, delays drive purchases, and allows drives to be added/removed without the file system noticing.",y
"Beyond traditional disk arrays, to what other storage devices have RAID concepts been generalized?",RAID concepts have been generalized to arrays of tapes and broadcast data over wireless networks (where blocks are split and broadcast with parity units).,y
What kind of problems does RAID NOT protect against?,"RAID does not protect against logical errors such as wrong file pointers, wrong pointers within file structure, incomplete writes ('torn writes'), or accidental overwrites of file system structures.",y
What is a significant risk with hardware RAID controller failures or software RAID bugs?,"Such failures or bugs can lead to total data loss, as RAID primarily protects against physical media errors, not other hardware or software errors.",y
What is Solaris ZFS?,"Solaris ZFS is an advanced file system, first included as part of Solaris, known for its innovative approach using checksums for data integrity.",y
How does ZFS use checksums for data integrity?,"ZFS maintains internal checksums of all blocks (data and metadata). These checksums are not kept with the checksummed block itself, but are stored with the pointer to the block (e.g., in an inode).",y
Define inode.,"In many file systems, an inode is a per-file data structure holding most of the metadata of the file.",y
How does ZFS detect and correct data corruption using checksums and mirroring?,"If ZFS reads a data block and its checksum is incorrect, the file system knows there's a problem. If the data is mirrored and one copy has an incorrect checksum while the other is correct, ZFS automatically updates the bad block with the good one.",y
What are the benefits of ZFS's comprehensive checksumming throughout its structures?,"It provides higher consistency, more robust error detection, and automatic error correction capabilities compared to traditional RAID implementations or standard file systems.",y
What other Linux file system has a similar checksum feature to ZFS?,The Linux BTRFS file system.,y
What is a common issue with most traditional RAID implementations regarding flexibility?,"They often lack flexibility in managing storage space, for example, making it difficult to change volume sizes or adapt to changing file system requirements over time.",y
How does ZFS address the lack of flexibility in traditional RAID and volume management?,"ZFS combines file-system management and volume management. Drives or partitions are gathered into 'pools' of storage, and the entire pool's free space is available to all ZFS file systems within that pool, eliminating artificial limits and the need to relocate/resize.",y
Define pool in ZFS.,"In ZFS, a pool refers to drives, partitions, or RAID sets that can contain one or more file systems.",y
What additional storage management features does ZFS provide for file systems within a pool?,"ZFS provides quotas to limit the size of a file system and reservations to assure its growth, both of which can be changed by the file-system owner at any time.",y
What is object storage?,"Object storage is an approach where data is placed into a storage pool as self-contained 'objects,' designed for programs and accessed via an object ID, rather than navigated through a traditional file system hierarchy.",y
How does object storage differ from traditional file systems?,"In object storage, there is no way for a user or program to navigate the pool directly to find objects; objects are typically accessed via a unique object ID.",y
What are two examples of object storage management software?,Hadoop file system (HDFS) and Ceph.,y
What kind of hardware is typically used for object storage systems?,"Object storage systems typically run on commodity hardware, not traditional RAID arrays.",y
What is a key advantage of object storage in terms of capacity?,"Horizontal scalability, meaning capacity can be scaled by adding more computers with internal or external disks to the storage pool, allowing for petabyte-scale pools.",y
Define horizontal scalability.,Horizontal scalability is the ability to scale capacity by adding more items (computers) rather than expanding one existing item.,y
What is a key feature of each object in object storage systems?,"Each object is self-describing, meaning it includes a description of its content.",y
What is another term for object storage based on its retrieval method?,Content-addressable storage.,y
Define content-addressable storage.,Content-addressable storage is another term for object storage; objects are retrieved based on their contents.,y
"What type of data is typically stored in object storage, and why?","Unstructured data, because there is no set format for the contents of objects.",y
Define unstructured data.,Unstructured data is data not in a fixed format but rather free-form.,y
Give examples of where huge amounts of data are stored in object stores.,"Google search contents, Dropbox files, Spotify songs, Facebook photos, and Amazon AWS S3 (for customer applications).",y
What are the major secondary storage I/O units?,Hard disk drives (HDDs) and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices.,y
How is modern secondary storage structured?,As large one-dimensional arrays of logical blocks.,y
How can drives be attached to a computer?,"1. Through local I/O ports on the host.
2. Directly connected to motherboards.
3. Through a communications network or storage network connection.",y
What systems generate requests for secondary storage I/O?,The file system and the virtual memory system.,y
How does each secondary storage I/O request specify the device address?,As a logical block number.,y
What do disk-scheduling algorithms aim to improve for HDDs?,"Effective bandwidth, average response time, and variance in response time.",y
How do algorithms like SCAN and C-SCAN improve HDD performance?,Via disk-queue ordering strategies.,y
How does HDD performance relate to scheduling algorithms?,It varies greatly with scheduling algorithms.,y
What are the characteristics of Solid-state disks (SSDs) in relation to moving parts and scheduling algorithms?,"They have no moving parts, and their performance varies little among different scheduling algorithms.",y
Which scheduling strategy do SSDs often use?,"A simple FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) strategy.",y
What is a common characteristic and outcome of data storage and transmission?,They are complex and frequently result in errors.,y
Define Error detection.,"The process that attempts to spot problems, alert the system for corrective action, and avoid error propagation.",y
Define Error correction.,"The process that detects and repairs problems, depending on available correction data and the amount of corruption.",y
How are storage devices typically organized?,They are partitioned into one or more chunks of space.,y
What can each partition of a storage device hold?,"A volume, or it can be part of a multidevice volume.",y

What are boot blocks and when are they allocated?,"Blocks allocated to store the system's bootstrap program, if the device contains the Operating System (OS).",y
What action must a system take if a block or page becomes corrupted?,The system must lock it out or logically replace it with a spare.,y
"What is key to good performance in some systems, related to memory management?",Efficient swap space.,y
How do some systems implement swap space?,By dedicating a raw partition to it.,y
How do other systems implement swap space?,By using a file within the file system.,y
