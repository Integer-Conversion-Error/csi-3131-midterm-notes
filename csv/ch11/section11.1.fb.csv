What is the primary role of mass storage in computer systems?,To permanently store files and data.
What types of secondary storage do modern computers primarily use?,Hard disk drives (HDDs) and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices.
List common variations among secondary storage devices.,"Transfer (character at a time vs. block), Access (sequentially vs. randomly), Data transfer (synchronously vs. asynchronously), Usage (dedicated vs. shared), Read-only vs. read-write, Speed (slowest major component)."
What are the key goals of an OS I/O subsystem?,"Provide the simplest interface possible to the rest of the system, and optimize I/O for maximum concurrency (devices are performance bottleneck)."
What is 'mass storage'?,The nonvolatile storage system of a computer.
What is the main mass-storage system?,Secondary storage (HDDs and NVM devices).
What types of tertiary storage exist for some systems?,"Slower, larger storage like magnetic tape, optical disks, and cloud storage."
What is the general term for all types of non-volatile storage?,"Non-volatile storage (NVS) or ""storage drives""."
hard disk drive (HDD),"Secondary storage device based on mechanical components (spinning magnetic media platters, moving read-write heads)."
nonvolatile memory (NVM),Persistent storage based on circuits and electric charges.
How is information stored and read on an HDD platter?,Information is stored by recording magnetically and read by detecting magnetic patterns.
platter,HDD component with a magnetic media layer for holding charges; flat circular shape (like a CD).
disk arm,"HDD component holding read-write heads, which moves all heads as a unit over cylinders of platters."
track,"On an HDD platter, the medium under the read-write head during platter rotation; logically a circular division of the platter surface."
sectors,"On an HDD platter, fixed-size sections that subdivide tracks."
cylinder,"On an HDD, the set of tracks under read-write heads on all platters in the device at a given arm position."
What is the smallest unit of transfer on an HDD?,A sector.
"What was the common sector size for HDDs until around 2010, and what is it migrating to?","Commonly 512 bytes until ~2010, then migrating to 4KB."
What are common rotation speeds (RPM) for HDD motors?,"5,400, 7,200, 10,000, 15,000 RPM."
transfer rate,The rate at which data flows between the drive and the computer.
positioning time,"On an HDD, the time for the read-write head to position over the desired track; also known as random-access time."
What are the two parts of positioning time (random-access time) for an HDD?,Seek time and rotational latency.
seek time,"On an HDD, the time for the disk arm to move the read-write head to the desired cylinder."
rotational latency,"On an HDD, the time for the desired sector to rotate to the disk head once the head is over the desired cylinder."
What are typical performance figures for modern disks in terms of transfer rate and latency?,"Tens to hundreds of MB/sec transfer, several milliseconds seek/rotational latency."
How do drive controllers improve HDD performance?,By using DRAM buffers.
head crash,"On an HDD, a mechanical problem where the read-write head touches the platter surface."
What is the consequence of a head crash on an HDD?,"It's normally irreparable, the entire disk is replaced, and data is lost unless backed up or RAID protected."
effective transfer rate,"The actual, measured transfer rate of data between two devices, which is typically lower than published rates."
What are NVM devices composed of?,A controller and flash NAND die semiconductor chips that store data.
solid-state disk (SSD),A disk-drive-like storage device using flash-memory-based nonvolatile memory.
USB drive,Nonvolatile memory in the form of a device that plugs into a USB port (also known as thumb drive/flash drive).
What are the advantages of NVM devices over HDDs?,"They are more reliable (no moving parts), faster (no seek/rotational latency), and consume less power."
What are the disadvantages of NVM devices compared to larger HDDs?,They are more expensive per MB and have less capacity.
What are the storage and reliability challenges with NAND semiconductors?,"Data cannot be overwritten directly (NAND cells must be erased first), and they deteriorate with every erase cycle (~100,000 program-erase cycles)."
"In what increments are NAND flash devices read/written, and in what increments are they erased?","Read/write in ""page"" increments (similar to a sector), and erasure occurs in ""block"" increments (several pages), which is much slower."
How is NVM lifespan measured?,In Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD).
flash translation layer (FTL),"For nonvolatile memory, a table maintained by the controller that maps physical pages to currently valid logical blocks."
What happens when a full SSD has a pending write and no free blocks?,"If no free blocks but individual pages hold invalid data, garbage collection occurs, where good data is copied to other locations, freeing blocks for erase/writes."
garbage collection,"The recovery of space containing no-longer-valid data, typically by copying valid data to new locations and then erasing the old block."
over-provisioning,"In non-volatile memory, space (e.g., 20% of total) set aside by the device as always available write area, not counted in device free space."
wear leveling,"In nonvolatile memory, an effort by the controller to select all NAND cells over time as write targets to avoid premature media failure due to frequently erased blocks."
How do NVM devices provide data protection?,They include error-correcting codes (ECC) calculated and stored with the data to detect and correct errors.
RAM drives,"Sections of a system's DRAM presented as secondary storage devices, created by device drivers."
What is a practical use of RAM drives despite their volatility?,"To allow users/programmers to place data in memory for temporary safekeeping using standard file operations, useful for temporary files or sharing data."
magnetic tape,"A nonvolatile magnetic media storage device (tape spooled on reels, passing over a read-write head); mostly used for backups, infrequently used info, or transferring info between systems."
How do magnetic tapes compare to main memory and drives in terms of random access time?,"Random access is very slow: ~1000x slower than HDDs, ~100,000x slower than SSDs."
"Once positioned correctly, how fast do tape drives read/write?",At speeds comparable to HDDs.
I/O bus,Physical connection of an I/O device to a computer system.
List some common bus types for connecting secondary storage.,"Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA), Serial ATA (SATA), eSATA, Serial Attached SCSI (SAS), Universal Serial Bus (USB), Fibre Channel (FC)."
Which bus type is most common for secondary storage?,SATA.
NVM express (NVMe),"A high-speed I/O bus specifically for NVM storage, which directly connects the device to the system PCI bus to increase throughput and decrease latency."
controller,A special processor managing I/O devices.
host bus adapter (HBA),A device controller installed in a host bus port to allow a device connection to the host.
host controller,"I/O-managing processors within a computer (e.g., inside an HBA)."
device controller,An I/O managing processor built into each storage device.
How does a mass storage I/O operation typically proceed?,"The computer places a command into the host controller (via memory-mapped I/O ports), which then sends the command via messages to the device controller. The device controller operates the drive hardware."
"Where does data transfer occur at the drive, and then to the host?","At the drive, data transfers between the device controller's built-in cache and the storage media. Data then transfers to the host between the cache and host DRAM via DMA at fast electronic speeds."
logical blocks,Logical addresses used to access blocks on storage devices; also the smallest unit of transfer.
How are storage devices logically addressed?,As large one-dimensional arrays of logical blocks.
What does a logical block map to physically on a device?,A physical sector or a semiconductor page.
"Why is converting LBA to old-style disk addresses (cylinder, track, sector) difficult in practice?","Because of defective sector substitution with spares, non-constant sectors per track on some drives, and internal management by disk manufacturers that hides the true physical mapping."
What assumption do algorithms dealing with HDDs make about logical and physical addresses?,That ascending logical addresses correspond to ascending physical addresses.
constant linear velocity (CLV),A device-recording method where bit density is uniform per track by varying the rotational speed of the medium.
Why do outer tracks in CLV have more sectors?,Because they are longer and bit density is uniform.
Where is CLV commonly used?,In CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives.
constant angular velocity (CAV),"A device-recording method where the medium spins at a constant velocity, and bit density decreases from inner to outer tracks to maintain a constant data rate."
Where is CAV commonly used?,In hard disks.
