What is the primary goal of disk-scheduling algorithms for Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)?,To minimize disk head movement.
What distinguishes NVM devices from HDDs in terms of physical components?,NVM devices have no moving disk heads.
What common scheduling policy do NVM devices typically use?,"Simple FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)."
Define the Linux NOOP scheduler.,A Linux NVM scheduling algorithm that uses an FCFS policy and merges adjacent requests.
Describe the characteristic of read service time in NVM devices.,Uniform.
Describe the characteristic of write service time in NVM devices and why it behaves that way.,"Not uniform, due to flash memory properties."
How do some SSD schedulers handle write requests?,They merge only adjacent write requests.
How do some SSD schedulers handle read requests?,They service all read requests in FCFS order.
What are the two main types of I/O access?,Sequential and random.
For which types of devices is sequential access I/O optimal?,Mechanical devices such as HDDs and tapes.
Why is sequential access optimal for mechanical devices?,"Because the data is located near the read/write head, minimizing movement."
Define Input/Output Operations Per Second (IOPS).,"A measure of random access I/O performance, representing the number of input and output operations per second."
What effect does random access I/O have on HDDs?,It causes disk head movement.
Compare random access I/O performance between NVM (SSDs) and HDDs.,"Random access I/O is much faster on NVM (e.g., HDD hundreds of IOPS, SSD hundreds of thousands of IOPS)."
Do NVM devices offer a significant advantage for raw sequential throughput compared to HDDs?,"Less advantage, because HDD head seeks are minimized during sequential operations."
What is the performance advantage of NVM over HDD for sequential reads?,Equivalent to a 10x advantage.
How does writing to NVM compare to reading from NVM in terms of speed?,Writing is slower than reading.
How does writing impact NVM's performance advantage over HDDs?,It decreases the advantage.
Describe the consistency of write performance for HDDs throughout their lifespan.,Consistent throughout device life.
What factors cause NVM write performance to vary?,"Device fullness (due to garbage collection and over-provisioning) and ""wear""."
How does the performance of a worn NVM device compare to a new one?,Much worse performance.
How can NVM lifespan and performance be improved through file system interaction?,"The file system informs the NVM device when files are deleted, allowing the device to erase blocks."
Under what general conditions does garbage collection typically occur in an NVM device?,"When the NVM device is under a random read/write load, is full, but has free space."
What is the primary purpose of garbage collection in NVM devices?,To reclaim space from invalid data.
Describe the sequence of operations a single write might trigger due to garbage collection in an NVM device.,"Read of pages, write of good data to overprovisioning space, erase of an all-invalid-data block, and placement of the block into overprovisioning space."
Summarize the I/O operations triggered by a single write request due to garbage collection.,One page write (for the new data) + one or more page reads (by GC) + one or more page writes (for good data from GC blocks).
Define write amplification.,"Creation of I/O requests by NVM devices (GC, space management), impacting write performance."
What is the worst-case scenario for write amplification?,Several extra I/Os are triggered with each write request.
