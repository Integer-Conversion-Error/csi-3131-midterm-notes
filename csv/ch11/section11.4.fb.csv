What is the fundamental importance of error detection and correction?,"They are fundamental to memory, networking, and storage."
Define: Error detection.,"Determining if a problem has occurred (e.g., data corruption)."
What actions can a system take upon detecting an error?,"Halt operation, report the error, or warn of a failing/failed device."
How do memory systems typically detect errors?,Using parity bits.
"What is a parity bit, and what is its association?","A bit associated with each byte, recording the even or odd number of 1s within that byte."
How does parity detect a single-bit error?,The calculated parity changes and does not match the stored parity.
How is an error detected if the stored parity bit itself is damaged?,It will not match the newly computed parity.
What types of errors are guaranteed to be detected by parity?,All single-bit errors.
What is a limitation of parity regarding multiple-bit errors?,Double-bit errors might go undetected.
How is a parity bit calculated?,By XORing the bits of the associated data.
What is the memory overhead required for parity?,An extra bit of memory per byte.
What general term encompasses parity as a form of error detection?,Checksums.
Define: Checksum.,A general term for an error detection and correction code.
How do checksums operate to detect errors?,"They use modular arithmetic to compute, store, and compare values on fixed-length words."
What is another error-detection method besides parity?,Cyclic redundancy check (CRCs).
Define: Cyclic redundancy check (CRCs).,An error-detection method using a hash function to detect multiple-bit errors.
Define: Error-correcting code (ECC).,"A value calculated from data bytes, recalculated later to check for changes, and capable of correcting errors."
How does ECC perform error correction?,It uses algorithms and extra storage.
What factors cause ECC codes to vary?,The extra storage needed and the number of errors correctable.
In what unit is ECC typically applied in disk drives?,Per-sector ECC.
In what unit is ECC typically applied in flash drives?,Per-page ECC.
Describe the ECC process during a write operation.,"When a controller writes a sector/page, the ECC is calculated from the data and written along with it."
Describe the ECC process during a read operation.,"When a sector/page is read, the ECC is recalculated from the data and compared with the stored ECC value."
What does an ECC mismatch during a read operation indicate?,"The data is corrupted, and the storage media may be bad."
How is ECC able to identify and correct corrupted bits?,"It contains enough information to identify changed bits and calculate correct values, provided only a few bits are corrupted."
Define: Soft error.,"A recoverable error, often by retrying the operation."
When does ECC signal a non-correctable error?,When there are too many changes for ECC to correct.
Define: Hard error.,"An unrecoverable error, possibly resulting in data loss."
Who is responsible for performing ECC processing on read/write operations?,The controller automatically.
How do error detection and correction influence product markets?,They frequently serve as differentiators between consumer and enterprise products.
What are additional applications of ECC in some systems?,DRAM error correction and data path protection.
