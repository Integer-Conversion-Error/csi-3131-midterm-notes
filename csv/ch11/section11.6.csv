"Why do some operating systems, like Linux, allow for multiple swap spaces, often on separate storage devices?",To provide redundancy in case one swap area fails.,To simplify disk partitioning.,To consolidate all I/O onto a single device.,To spread the I/O load from paging/swapping over the system's I/O bandwidth.,To allow different file systems to use different swap policies.,D,The purpose of multiple swap spaces is to 'spread I/O load from paging/swapping over system's I/O bandwidth'.
What are the two primary locations where swap space can reside on a storage device?,In CPU cache or GPU memory.,In RAM disk or network share.,Carved out of a normal file system (as a large file) or in a separate raw partition.,Within the kernel's protected memory or user space.,In ROM or on a floppy disk.,C,Swap space can reside in 'Carved out of normal file system (large file)' or 'In a separate raw partition'.
What is a 'raw partition' in the context of swap space?,A partition primarily used for user data storage.,A partition that contains a dedicated file system for swap files.,A partition within a storage device that does not contain a file system.,A partition accessible only by the system administrator.,A virtual partition created in main memory.,C,A 'raw partition' is defined as a 'Partition within a storage device not containing a file system'.
"When swap space is located in a raw partition, what entity is responsible for allocating and deallocating blocks?",The standard file system routines.,The user application managing the process.,A separate swap-space storage manager.,The hardware disk controller directly.,The network file system daemon.,C,"For raw partitions, a 'separate swap-space storage manager allocates/deallocates blocks'."
What is the primary optimization goal for the algorithms used by a swap-space storage manager for raw partitions?,Storage efficiency.,Data integrity and backup.,Speed.,Minimizing internal fragmentation over the long term.,User accessibility.,C,The manager uses algorithms 'optimized for speed (not storage efficiency)'.
How is internal fragmentation typically viewed in the context of swap space on a raw partition?,It is entirely eliminated due to optimized algorithms.,It is a major long-term problem that must be avoided.,"It may increase, but is considered an acceptable trade-off due to short data life and reinitialization at boot.",It only occurs if the system experiences a power failure.,"It is managed by the file system, not the swap manager.",C,"Internal fragmentation 'may increase (acceptable trade-off, data life shorter)', and is 'short-lived (reinitialized at boot time)'."
"If an operating system relies on raw partitions for swap space, how is adding more swap space typically accomplished?",By simply creating a new large file in the existing file system.,Automatically by the OS as needed.,Through repartitioning the device or adding another swap space elsewhere.,"By connecting a new USB drive, which is then automatically configured.",It is not possible to add more once set up.,C,Adding more raw partition swap space requires 'repartitioning device (moving/destroying other partitions) or adding another swap space elsewhere'.

What significant change was introduced in later Solaris versions regarding swap space allocation?,Swap space was entirely eliminated.,Swap space was allocated for every virtual memory page creation.,Swap space was allocated only when a page was forced out of physical memory.,"Swap space was only used for system files, not process data.",Swap space was dynamically resized based on CPU load.,C,Later Solaris versions 'allocates swap space only when page forced out of physical memory (not when virtual memory page first created)'.
What is the primary benefit of the later Solaris swap space allocation scheme (allocating only when a page is forced out)?,"It uses more swap space, thus improving reliability.",It simplifies disk partitioning.,It provides better performance on modern computers with more physical memory.,It allows for more efficient file system journaling.,It reduces the need for CPU context switching.,C,"This scheme provides 'better performance on modern computers (more physical memory, page less)'."

"In a Linux swap map, what does a counter value greater than 0 for a page slot indicate?",The page slot is available for use.,The page slot is corrupted.,"The page slot is occupied by a swapped page, and the value indicates the number of mappings to that page.",The page slot is reserved for future use.,The page slot is part of the file system.,C,A 'Counter value > 0: page slot occupied by swapped page. Counter value: indicates number of mappings to swapped page'.
