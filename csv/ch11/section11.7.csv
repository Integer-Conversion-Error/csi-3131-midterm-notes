What is a major downside of Network-attached storage (NAS) compared to some direct-attached storage?,It lacks file sharing capabilities between hosts.,"It requires complex, custom hardware for implementation.",It is generally less efficient and offers lower performance.,It can only be accessed by a single client at a time.,It relies exclusively on Fibre Channel for connectivity.,C,"The text mentions a 'Downside: less efficient, lower performance than some direct-attached storage'."
Which network-attached storage protocol uses an IP network to carry the SCSI protocol?,NFS,CIFS,iSCSI,Fibre Channel (FC),InfiniBand (IB),C,The text identifies 'iSCSI' as the 'latest network-attached storage protocol' that 'Uses IP network protocol to carry SCSI protocol'.
How does iSCSI differ from NFS/CIFS in terms of how it presents storage and transfers data?,"iSCSI presents a file system and sends parts of files, while NFS/CIFS sends logical blocks.","iSCSI sends logical blocks across the network, while NFS/CIFS presents a file system and sends parts of files.","iSCSI uses optical fiber, while NFS/CIFS uses copper cables.","iSCSI is only for local networks, while NFS/CIFS is for wide-area networks.","iSCSI is API-based, while NFS/CIFS uses traditional file sharing protocols.",B,"The text states: 'NFS/CIFS: present file system, send parts of files. iSCSI: sends logical blocks across network, client uses blocks directly or creates file system'."
What is a key distinction of Cloud storage compared to Network-attached storage (NAS)?,"Cloud storage is accessed via local I/O ports, while NAS uses network protocols.","Cloud storage is accessed over the Internet/WAN to a remote data center, unlike NAS which is usually over a LAN.","Cloud storage typically uses NFS/CIFS for access, while NAS is API-based.","Cloud storage primarily focuses on block-level access, while NAS is file-level.",Cloud storage does not require any network connectivity.,B,The text states: 'Unlike NAS: accessed over Internet/WAN to remote data center (storage for fee/free)' for cloud storage.
"How is cloud storage typically accessed by programs, contrasting with how NAS is accessed?","Cloud storage uses traditional file system protocols like NFS/CIFS, while NAS uses proprietary APIs.","Cloud storage is accessed as another file system or raw block device, while NAS is API-based.","Cloud storage uses standard TCP/UDP over IP, while NAS uses specialized storage protocols.","Cloud storage is API based; programs use APIs to access, while NAS integrates existing protocols (CIFS/NFS or iSCSI).","Cloud storage bypasses the OS for direct hardware access, unlike NAS.",D,The text clarifies: 'NAS: accessed as another file system (CIFS/NFS) or raw block device (iSCSI). OS integrates these protocols. Cloud storage: API based; programs use APIs to access.'
What is the primary reason given for why cloud storage uses APIs instead of existing LAN protocols like NFS/CIFS?,APIs are less secure than traditional LAN protocols.,Existing protocols are too complex for cloud environments.,WAN latency and failure scenarios make LAN protocols unsuitable.,"APIs allow for direct integration with hardware, bypassing software layers.",Cloud providers prefer to lock users into their proprietary systems.,C,The text states: 'Reason for APIs vs. existing protocols: WAN latency and failure scenarios'.
What is a significant drawback of Network-attached storage (NAS) that Storage-area networks (SANs) aim to address?,NAS devices are typically more expensive than SANs.,"NAS requires proprietary hardware, while SAN uses off-the-shelf components.","NAS storage I/O consumes data network bandwidth, increasing network communication latency.",NAS offers limited flexibility in allocating storage to hosts.,NAS cannot be shared by multiple hosts simultaneously.,C,"The text explicitly states: 'Drawback of NAS: storage I/O consumes data network bandwidth, increases network communication latency.' and SANs are introduced as a solution for large installations where 'server-client communication competes with server-storage communication'."
