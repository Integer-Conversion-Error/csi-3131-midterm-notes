What are the three ways computers access secondary storage?,"Host-attached, network-attached, and cloud storage.",y
Define host-attached storage.,Storage accessed through local I/O ports (directly attached to a computer).,y
What is the most common local I/O port for host-attached storage?,SATA.,y
How can a system gain more storage access beyond its typical few SATA ports?,"By connecting individual storage devices, devices in a chassis, or multiple drives in a chassis via USB, FireWire, or Thunderbolt.",y
What kind of I/O architectures are used by high-end workstations and servers that need more/shared storage?,Sophisticated I/O architectures.,y
What is Fibre Channel (FC)?,A high-speed serial architecture (optical fiber or copper cable) used in data centers to connect computers to storage arrays.,y
What are the benefits of Fibre Channel (FC)?,"Large address space, switched communication, and the ability to attach multiple hosts/storage devices to the fabric, providing flexibility in I/O communication.",y
Name some devices suitable for host-attached storage.,"HDDs, NVM devices, CD/DVD/Blu-ray/tape drives, and storage-area networks (SANs).",y
How are I/O commands for host-attached storage directed?,Reads/writes of logical data blocks are directed to specifically identified storage units (via bus ID or target logical unit).,y
Define Network-Attached Storage (NAS).,Storage accessed from a computer across a network.,y
What types of systems can a NAS device be?,A special-purpose storage system or a general computer system providing storage to other hosts.,y
How do clients typically access NAS?,Via a remote-procedure-call (RPC) interface.,y
Name common RPC interfaces used for NAS.,NFS (for UNIX/Linux) and CIFS (for Windows).,y
How are RPCs for NAS typically carried?,"Via TCP/UDP over an IP network, usually within the same LAN.",y
How is a NAS unit usually implemented?,As a storage array with RPC interface software.,y
What features do CIFS and NFS provide for NAS?,"Locking features, allowing file sharing between hosts accessing the NAS.",y
What is a key convenience of NAS for LAN computers?,"It provides a convenient way to share a storage pool, offering ease of naming and access.",y
What is a downside of NAS compared to some direct-attached storage?,It is less efficient and has lower performance.,y
What is iSCSI?,The latest network-attached storage protocol that uses the IP network protocol to carry the SCSI protocol.,y
What does iSCSI use instead of SCSI cables for interconnects between hosts and storage?,IP networks.,y
How do hosts treat storage accessed via iSCSI?,"As if it were directly attached, even if it is distant.",y
What is the difference in data transfer between NFS/CIFS and iSCSI?,"NFS/CIFS present a file system and send parts of files, whereas iSCSI sends logical blocks across the network, allowing the client to use blocks directly or create a file system.",y
Define Cloud storage.,"Storage accessed over the Internet/WAN to a remote, shared data center, often provided for a fee or free. It is similar to network-attached storage but accessed differently.",y
How does cloud storage differ from NAS in terms of access and presentation?,"NAS is accessed as another file system (CIFS/NFS) or raw block device (iSCSI), with the OS integrating these protocols. Cloud storage is API based, meaning programs use APIs to access it.",y
Name some examples of cloud storage services.,"Amazon S3, Dropbox, Microsoft OneDrive, Apple iCloud.",y
Why do cloud storage services typically use APIs instead of existing protocols like NFS/CIFS?,Due to WAN latency and the higher likelihood of failure scenarios.,y
For what type of networks are NAS protocols (NFS/CIFS) designed?,"LANs, which have lower latency and less connectivity loss.",y
What can happen if a LAN connection fails when using NFS/CIFS?,The system might hang.,y
How do applications handle failures with cloud storage?,"Failures are more likely, and the application typically pauses access until connectivity is restored.",y
"What is a drawback of NAS, especially in large client-server installations?","Storage I/O consumes data network bandwidth, increasing network communication latency, and server-client communication competes with server-storage communication.",y
What is a Storage-Area Network (SAN)?,"A private network connecting servers and storage units, using storage protocols rather than networking protocols. It is a local-area storage network allowing multiple computers to connect to storage devices.",y
What is the primary strength of a SAN?,Flexibility.,y
What can attach to the same SAN fabric?,Multiple hosts and storage arrays.,y
How is storage allocated to hosts in a SAN?,It is dynamically allocated.,y
What types of drives are found in storage arrays?,RAID protected or unprotected drives (Just a Bunch of Disks - JBOD).,y
What is Just a Bunch of Disks (JBOD)?,Unprotected drives in a storage array.,y
What is the function of a SAN switch?,It allows or prohibits access between hosts and storage.,y
Provide an example of how a SAN can be configured to help a host.,"If a host is low on disk space, the SAN can be configured to allocate more storage to it.",y
How do SANs facilitate sharing for server clusters?,Clusters of servers can share the same storage.,y
How do SANs typically compare to storage arrays in terms of ports and cost?,SANs typically have more ports and higher cost.,y
"What are the typical characteristics of SAN connectivity regarding distance, routing, and number of connected hosts?","Short distances, typically no routing, and NAS can have more connected hosts than SAN.",y
What is a storage array?,"A purpose-built device that includes SAN/network ports (or both) and contains drives to store data, along with controller(s) to manage storage and access.",y
What components are found within storage array controllers?,"CPUs, memory, and software.",y
Name some features implemented by storage array controllers' software.,"Network protocols, UIs (user interfaces), RAID, snapshots, replication, compression, deduplication, and encryption.",y
What types of drives can some storage arrays include?,SSDs.,y
What are the characteristics of a storage array with only SSDs?,Maximum performance but smaller capacity.,y
How is a mix of SSDs and HDDs typically managed in a storage array?,"Array software or the administrator selects the best medium for data, or SSDs are used as cache and HDDs as bulk storage.",y
What is the most common SAN interconnect?,Fibre Channel (FC).,y
Which SAN interconnect is increasing in use due to its simplicity?,iSCSI.,y
What is InfiniBand (IB)?,A special-purpose bus architecture that provides hardware and software support for high-speed interconnection networks between servers and storage units.,y
