What is the primary purpose of Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAIDs)?,"RAIDs are disk-organization techniques used to improve data read/write rates through parallel operation and to enhance data storage reliability through redundant information, preventing data loss upon a single drive failure."
Define Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks (RAID).,"RAID is a disk organization technique where two or more storage devices work together, usually with protection from device failure."
How has the meaning of the 'I' in RAID changed historically?,"Originally, 'I' stood for 'inexpensive' as RAIDs were a cost-effective alternative to large, expensive disks. Today, it stands for 'independent'."
What is Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)?,MTBF is the statistical mean time a device is expected to work correctly before failing.
Why is redundancy introduced in storage systems like RAID?,"Redundancy is introduced to store extra information not normally needed, which is then used to rebuild lost information if a disk fails, preventing data loss."
Define Mirroring in the context of RAID.,"Mirroring is a storage RAID protection scheme where two physical devices contain the same content; if one fails, data is read from the other."
What is a Mirrored Volume?,"A mirrored volume is a logical disk composed of two physical drives, where every write operation is performed on both drives."
What factors determine the Mean Time to Data Loss for a mirrored volume?,The Mean Time to Data Loss for a mirrored volume depends on the MTBF of individual drives and the mean time to repair (average time to replace a failed drive and restore data).
Define Mean Time to Repair.,Mean time to repair is the statistical mean of time required to replace a failed drive and restore data.
Define Mean Time to Data Loss.,Mean time to data loss is the statistical mean of the time until data is irrecoverably lost in a redundant storage system.
How do RAID systems mitigate inconsistent states caused by power failures during writes?,"Solutions include writing one copy first then the next, or adding a solid-state nonvolatile cache (NVRAM) to the RAID array, which protects write-back cache data from loss (assuming the cache itself has error protection/correction)."
How does mirroring improve performance in a RAID system?,"Mirroring doubles the read request rate because reads can be sent to either drive. While the transfer rate per individual read remains the same as a single drive, the number of reads per unit time is doubled."
What is Data Striping?,Data striping is the technique of splitting data across multiple drives to improve the overall transfer rate.
Define Bit-Level Striping.,"Bit-level striping is the simplest form of data striping where bits of each byte are split and stored on separate drives. For example, in an 8-drive array, bit 'i' of each byte would go to drive 'i'."
Define Block-Level Striping.,"Block-level striping is a form of data striping where blocks of a file are distributed across multiple drives. With 'n' drives, block 'i' of a file typically goes to drive (i modulo n) + 1."
What are the two main goals of parallelism via striping in storage systems?,"The goals are to increase the throughput of multiple small accesses (e.g., page accesses) by load balancing, and to reduce the response time of large accesses by reading from all disks in parallel."
What are RAID Levels?,"RAID levels are classifications for various disk-organization schemes that offer different cost-performance trade-offs by combining striping with various methods of redundancy (e.g., parity bits or mirroring)."
Describe RAID Level 0.,RAID Level 0 consists of drive arrays with block-level striping but no redundancy. It offers high performance but no data protection against drive failure.
Describe RAID Level 1.,RAID Level 1 is drive mirroring. It provides high reliability by duplicating data but is expensive due to doubling the required storage.
Describe the core concept of RAID Level 4.,"RAID Level 4 uses a memory-style Error-Correcting-Code (ECC) organization. Data blocks are striped across N drives, and an ECC calculation result (parity block) is stored on a dedicated N+1 drive. It allows recovery from a single drive failure."
What is a Read-Modify-Write Cycle in the context of RAID?,"A read-modify-write cycle occurs when a write operation is smaller than a full block. The entire block must be read, modified with the new data, and then written back along with an updated parity block."
"What are the advantages of RAID Level 4 over RAID Level 1, given equal data protection?",RAID 4 offers reduced storage overhead (one parity drive for several data drives vs. a mirror for every drive) and faster transfer rates for reads/writes of block series due to N-way striping.
"What is the main performance problem with RAID Level 4 and other parity-based RAIDs, and how is it mitigated?","The main performance problem is the expense of computing and writing XOR parity, which can slow down small writes (requiring a read-modify-write cycle). This is mitigated by fast modern CPUs, dedicated parity hardware in controllers, and NVRAM caches that buffer writes and avoid most read-modify-write cycles."
Describe RAID Level 5.,"RAID Level 5 is characterized by block-interleaved distributed parity. Instead of a single dedicated parity drive (like RAID 4), data and parity blocks are spread among all N+1 drives, avoiding the performance bottleneck of a single parity drive."
What is the P + Q redundancy scheme in RAID?,"The P + Q redundancy scheme, used in RAID Level 6, involves storing extra redundant information beyond simple XOR parity. It typically uses advanced error-correcting codes, like Galois field math, to calculate two distinct parity blocks (P and Q) for a set of data blocks, enabling tolerance of up to two drive failures."
What is Galois field math used for in RAID?,"Galois field math is used in RAID Level 6 (P + Q redundancy) to calculate the second independent parity block (Q), allowing the system to tolerate two drive failures by using advanced error-correcting codes."
What is Multidimensional RAID Level 6?,"Multidimensional RAID Level 6 amplifies the protection of standard RAID 6 by logically arranging hundreds of drives into rows and columns and implementing RAID 6 both horizontally (across rows) and vertically (down columns), allowing recovery from multiple failures in any location."
What are RAID Levels 0+1 and 1+0?,RAID 0+1 (often called RAID 10) and RAID 1+0 (often called RAID 01) are combined RAID levels that merge the performance benefits of RAID 0 (striping) with the reliability benefits of RAID 1 (mirroring). They are expensive as they double the number of drives needed.
What is the key difference in resilience between RAID 0+1 and RAID 1+0 after a single drive failure?,"In RAID 0+1, a single drive failure makes the entire striped set (sub-array) inaccessible, leaving only the mirrored copy available. In RAID 1+0, a single drive failure makes only that specific drive unavailable, with its mirror taking over, and the rest of the striped drives remain available, offering better resilience."
List common implementations of RAID.,"RAID can be implemented via: Volume-management software (kernel/system layer), Host Bus Adapter (HBA) hardware, Storage array hardware, or at the Storage Area Network (SAN) interconnect layer via drive virtualization devices."
Define Snapshot in file systems.,"A snapshot in file systems is a read-only view of a file system at a particular point in time, showing its state before the last update."
Define Replication in file systems.,"Replication in file systems is the automatic duplication and synchronization of data over a network to another system, primarily for redundancy and disaster recovery."
What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous replication?,"Synchronous replication requires a block to be written both locally and remotely before the write is considered complete, ensuring no data loss. Asynchronous replication groups writes and sends them periodically, which is faster and has no distance limitations, but may incur data loss if the primary site fails before writes are replicated."
What is a Hot Spare drive?,A hot spare is an unused storage device that is configured as an automatic replacement for a failed drive in a RAID set. It is not used for data storage but is ready to be used to recover data and reestablish the RAID level without human intervention.
Why is rebuild performance an important consideration when selecting a RAID level?,"Rebuild performance, the time it takes to rebuild data if a drive fails, is crucial for systems requiring continuous data supply (e.g., high-performance databases). It also influences the overall Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF) of the system."
Which RAID level is easiest for rebuilding after a drive failure?,"RAID Level 1 (mirroring) is the easiest for rebuilding, as data can simply be copied from the healthy mirrored drive."
For what type of applications is RAID Level 0 typically used?,"RAID Level 0 is used in high-performance applications where data loss is not critical, such as scientific computing, due to its lack of redundancy."
For what type of applications is RAID Level 1 typically used?,"RAID Level 1 is popular for applications requiring high reliability with fast recovery, such as small databases."
What is the primary disadvantage of RAID Level 1?,"The primary disadvantage of RAID Level 1 is its high space overhead, as it requires double the storage capacity due to mirroring."
Which RAID level is often preferred for moderate data volumes?,"RAID Level 5 is often preferred for moderate data volumes, balancing performance, protection, and storage efficiency."
Which RAID levels are most common in storage arrays and why?,RAID Level 6 and Multidimensional RAID 6 are most common in storage arrays because they offer good performance and protection (tolerating multiple drive failures) without incurring the large space overhead of mirroring.
What is unique about how the InServ storage array (HP 3Par) handles RAID?,"The InServ storage array does not require drives to be configured at a specific RAID level. Instead, each drive is broken into 256-MB 'chunklets,' and RAID is applied at the chunklet level. A single drive can participate in multiple, various RAID levels across different volumes."
"Define Utility Storage, as featured in the InServ array.","Utility storage is an InServ feature that allows an administrator to configure a host with a large logical storage space, but initially allocate only a small amount of physical storage. As the host uses more storage, unused drives (or 'chunklets' in InServ's case) are dynamically allocated up to the original logical level, without the file system noticing changes."
List types of problems that RAID does NOT protect against.,"RAID does not protect against logical errors such as wrong file pointers, wrong pointers within file structures, incomplete writes ('torn writes'), accidental overwrites of file system structures, or total data loss due to hardware RAID controller failure or software RAID bugs."
What is Solaris ZFS?,"Solaris ZFS is an advanced file system, first included as part of Solaris, known for its innovative approach to data integrity using checksums and its integrated file system and volume management capabilities."
How does Solaris ZFS enhance data consistency and error correction?,"ZFS maintains internal checksums for all blocks (data and metadata), storing these checksums with the pointers to the blocks (e.g., in the inode for data blocks). If a block's checksum is incorrect, ZFS detects the problem and, if mirrored, automatically updates the bad block with the good one, providing higher consistency, error detection, and error correction than standard RAID or file systems."
Define Inode in file systems.,"An inode (index node) is a per-file data structure in many file systems that holds most of the metadata of the file, such as permissions, ownership, timestamps, and pointers to the file's data blocks."
What is a Pool in Solaris ZFS?,"In ZFS, a pool is a logical grouping of drives, partitions, or RAID sets that can contain one or more ZFS file systems. The entire pool's free space is available to all file systems within that pool, providing flexible storage allocation."
How does ZFS address the flexibility limitations of traditional RAID and volume management?,"ZFS combines file system management and volume management, allowing drives or partitions to be gathered into flexible 'pools' of storage. File systems within a pool can dynamically use the pool's free space without artificial limits, relocation, or resizing, avoiding the need to pre-allocate fixed-size volumes."
What is Object Storage?,"Object storage is an alternative data storage approach, typically computer-oriented and designed for programs, where data is placed as self-describing 'objects' into a flat storage pool. Objects are accessed, created, or deleted via unique object IDs rather than through a traditional navigable file system hierarchy."
How does Object Storage differ from traditional file systems?,"Unlike file systems, object storage provides no way to navigate the storage pool or find objects directly; instead, objects are accessed via unique object IDs. It is designed for programs rather than direct user interaction and often runs on commodity hardware without traditional RAID arrays, relying on software for data protection."
Define Hadoop File System (HDFS).,"HDFS is an example of object storage management software, commonly used in Hadoop clusters, which determines where to store objects and manages their protection, often by storing copies of objects on different computers."
Define Ceph.,"Ceph is a brand of object storage management software known for its distributed, scalable object, block, and file storage capabilities."
"What is the primary advantage of Object Storage, especially in large-scale deployments?","The primary advantage of object storage is horizontal scalability, meaning capacity can be increased simply by adding more computers with internal or external disks to the storage pool, allowing for petabytes of storage."
Define Horizontal Scalability.,"Horizontal scalability is the ability to increase capacity (e.g., storage capacity or processing power) by adding more items (such as individual computers or storage nodes) to a system, rather than expanding the capabilities of a single, existing item."
"What is another term for Object Storage, and why is it called that?","Another term for object storage is Content-Addressable Storage, because objects can be retrieved based on their contents or properties rather than a fixed path or name."
Define Unstructured Data in the context of object storage.,"Unstructured data refers to data that does not have a fixed format but is rather free-form, a characteristic often found in objects stored in object storage systems."
List common real-world examples of data stored in object stores.,"Common examples include Google search contents, Dropbox files, Spotify songs, Facebook photos, and data objects for customer applications in cloud computing services like Amazon S3."
