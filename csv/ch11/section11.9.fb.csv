Front,Back
What are the major secondary storage I/O units?,Hard disk drives (HDDs) and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices.
How is modern secondary storage structured?,As large one-dimensional arrays of logical blocks.
List the ways drives can be attached to a computer.,"1. Through local I/O ports on host.
2. Directly connected to motherboards.
3. Through communications network or storage network connection."
What generates requests for secondary storage I/O?,File system and virtual memory system.
What does each secondary storage I/O request specify?,Device address as a logical block number.
What is the purpose of disk-scheduling algorithms for HDDs?,"To improve HDD effective bandwidth, average response time, and variance in response time."
How do SCAN and C-SCAN algorithms improve HDD performance?,Via disk-queue ordering strategies.
How does HDD performance vary with scheduling algorithms?,It varies greatly.
What is a key physical characteristic of Solid-state disks (SSDs)?,They have no moving parts.
How does SSD performance vary among scheduling algorithms?,Performance varies little among algorithms.
What is the typical scheduling strategy used by SSDs?,"Simple FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)."
What is a common outcome of complex data storage and transmission?,Errors frequently result.
Define Error detection.,"Attempts to spot problems, alert the system for corrective action, and avoid error propagation."
Define Error correction.,"Detects and repairs problems, depending on correction data and the amount of corruption."
How are storage devices typically partitioned?,Into one or more chunks of space.
What can each partition on a storage device hold?,A volume or be part of a multidevice volume.
Where are file systems created?,In volumes.
Who manages a storage device's blocks?,The OS (Operating System).
What is the typical state of new storage devices when they arrive?,Typically pre-formatted.
What steps are taken after a device is pre-formatted for use?,"The device is partitioned, and file systems are created."
"What are boot blocks allocated for, if a device contains an OS?",To store the system's bootstrap program.
What action must the system take if a block or page becomes corrupted?,The system must lock out or logically replace it with a spare.
What is key to good performance in some systems regarding memory management?,Efficient swap space.
How do some systems implement swap space?,They dedicate a raw partition to swap space.
How do other systems implement swap space?,They use a file within the file system.
What options do some systems provide for swap space implementation?,"They provide both dedicating a raw partition or using a file within the file system, leaving the decision to the user or administrator."
Why are secondary storage devices in large systems frequently made redundant?,Via RAID algorithms.
What benefits do RAID algorithms provide?,"They allow more than one drive for operation, and enable continued operation/automatic recovery from drive failure."
How are RAID algorithms organized?,Into different levels.
What does each RAID level provide?,A specific combination of reliability and high transfer rates.
What is Object storage used for?,"Big data problems, such as Internet indexing and cloud photo storage."
How are objects in object storage characterized and addressed?,"They are self-defining collections of data, addressed by an object ID (not a file name)."
What is typically used for data protection in object storage?,Replication.
Where do computes based on data happen in object storage systems?,On systems where a copy of the data exists.
What is a key scalability characteristic of object storage?,It is horizontally scalable for vast capacity and easy expansion.
