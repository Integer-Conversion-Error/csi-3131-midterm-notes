What are the major secondary storage I/O units?,Hard disk drives (HDDs) and nonvolatile memory (NVM) devices.,y
How is modern secondary storage structured?,As large one-dimensional arrays of logical blocks.,y
How can drives be attached to a computer?,"1. Through local I/O ports on the host.
2. Directly connected to motherboards.
3. Through a communications network or storage network connection.",y
What systems generate requests for secondary storage I/O?,The file system and the virtual memory system.,y
How does each secondary storage I/O request specify the device address?,As a logical block number.,y
What do disk-scheduling algorithms aim to improve for HDDs?,"Effective bandwidth, average response time, and variance in response time.",y
How do algorithms like SCAN and C-SCAN improve HDD performance?,Via disk-queue ordering strategies.,y
How does HDD performance relate to scheduling algorithms?,It varies greatly with scheduling algorithms.,y
What are the characteristics of Solid-state disks (SSDs) in relation to moving parts and scheduling algorithms?,"They have no moving parts, and their performance varies little among different scheduling algorithms.",y
Which scheduling strategy do SSDs often use?,"A simple FCFS (First-Come, First-Served) strategy.",y
What is a common characteristic and outcome of data storage and transmission?,They are complex and frequently result in errors.,y
Define Error detection.,"The process that attempts to spot problems, alert the system for corrective action, and avoid error propagation.",y
Define Error correction.,"The process that detects and repairs problems, depending on available correction data and the amount of corruption.",y
How are storage devices typically organized?,They are partitioned into one or more chunks of space.,y
What can each partition of a storage device hold?,"A volume, or it can be part of a multidevice volume.",y
Where are file systems created?,In volumes.,y
What manages a storage device's blocks?,The Operating System (OS).,y
How are new storage devices typically supplied?,Typically pre-formatted.,y
What are boot blocks and when are they allocated?,"Blocks allocated to store the system's bootstrap program, if the device contains the Operating System (OS).",y
What action must a system take if a block or page becomes corrupted?,The system must lock it out or logically replace it with a spare.,y
"What is key to good performance in some systems, related to memory management?",Efficient swap space.,y
How do some systems implement swap space?,By dedicating a raw partition to it.,y
How do other systems implement swap space?,By using a file within the file system.,y
What other options exist for swap space implementation?,"Some systems provide both dedicating a raw partition and using a file within the file system, allowing for user/admin decision.",y
How are secondary storage devices in large systems frequently made redundant?,Via RAID algorithms.,y
What do RAID algorithms allow for in storage systems?,"They allow more than one drive for operation, and enable continued operation or automatic recovery from drive failure.",y
How are RAID algorithms organized and what does each level provide?,"They are organized into different levels, with each level providing a specific combination of reliability and high transfer rates.",y
What is Object storage used for?,"It is used for big data problems, such as Internet indexing and cloud photo storage.",y
How are objects defined and addressed in object storage?,"They are self-defining collections of data, addressed by an object ID (not a file name).",y
What method is typically used for data protection in object storage?,Replication.,y
Where do computations based on data occur in object storage systems?,On systems where a copy of the data exists.,y
"What is a key scalability characteristic of object storage, and why is it important?","It is horizontally scalable, allowing for vast capacity and easy expansion.",y
