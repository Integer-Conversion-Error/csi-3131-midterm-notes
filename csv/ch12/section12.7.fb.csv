What is a major factor in system performance?,I/O
How do heavy I/O demands affect the CPU?,They place heavy demands on the CPU by requiring execution of device-driver code and scheduling processes (blocking/unblocking).
What is the impact of context switches during I/O on system components?,They stress the CPU and hardware caches.
What can be exposed by heavy I/O demands in the kernel?,Inefficiencies in the kernel's interrupt-handling mechanisms.
How does I/O activity load the memory bus?,Through data copies between controllers/physical memory and kernel buffers/application space.
What is a major concern for computer architects regarding I/O?,Graceful coping with I/O demands.
Why is interrupt handling considered relatively expensive?,"It involves a state change, execution of the handler, and restoration of the state."
Under what condition can Programmed I/O (PIO) be more efficient than interrupt-driven I/O?,If busy waiting is minimized.
What overhead results from I/O completion unblocking a process?,Full context switch overhead.
What is a characteristic of network traffic in terms of system overhead?,High context-switch rate.
"In a remote login, what is the sequence of events on the local machine when a character is typed?",Character typed → keyboard interrupt → interrupt handler → device driver → kernel → user process.
"In a remote login, describe the network I/O system call process initiated by the user on the local machine.",User process issues network I/O system call → local kernel → network layers (packet construction) → network device driver.
"In a remote login, what happens after the network device driver processes the packet on the local machine?","Network device driver transfers packet to controller → sends character, generates interrupt."
How does the network I/O system call complete on the local machine in a remote login scenario?,Interrupt back up through kernel → network I/O system call completes.
"In a remote login, what is the initial event on the remote system when a packet is received?",Network hardware receives packet → interrupt generated.
"In a remote login, what happens on the remote system after an interrupt is generated for a received packet?",Character is unpacked from protocols → passed to the appropriate network daemon.
"In a remote login, how does the network daemon process the character on the remote system?",Network daemon identifies session → passes packet to subdaemon.
What type of overhead is consistently observed throughout the remote login character example?,Context switches and state switches.
What is the impact of the receiver echoing a character in a remote login scenario?,It doubles the work.
What is one way some systems reduce the main CPU's interrupt burden for terminal I/O?,By using separate front-end processors.
What is the primary job of an I/O channel?,To offload I/O work from the main CPU and keep data flowing smoothly.

"What are some functions of a complex I/O device driver, such as a Windows disk driver?","Manages individual disks, implements RAID arrays, converts requests to disk I/O, performs error handling, data recovery, and optimizes performance."
What are the three main locations where I/O functionality can be implemented?,"Device hardware, device driver (kernel), or application software."
Where were experimental I/O algorithms initially implemented?,At the application level.
What are the advantages of implementing experimental I/O algorithms at the application level?,"Flexible, bugs are unlikely to crash the system, and no reboot/reload of drivers is needed after code changes."
What are the disadvantages of implementing experimental I/O algorithms at the application level?,"Innefficient due to context switch overhead, and lacks access to internal kernel data/functionality (e.g., messaging, threading, locking)."
What is an example of a system interface that allows user-mode file systems?,FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace).
Where are I/O algorithms typically reimplemented once they are proven?,In the kernel.
What is the main advantage of reimplementing I/O functionality in the kernel?,Improves performance.
What are the challenges of reimplementing I/O functionality in the kernel?,"More challenging development (due to large, complex kernel), and must be thoroughly debugged to avoid data corruption or system crashes."
Where is the highest I/O performance achieved?,Through specialized implementation in hardware (device or controller).
What are the disadvantages of implementing I/O functionality in hardware?,"Difficulty/expense of improvements/bug fixes, increased development time (months vs. days), and decreased flexibility (e.g., hardware RAID controller may not allow the kernel to influence I/O order/location)."
What is the current trend observed in I/O device speed?,"I/O devices are increasing in speed, with NVM devices nearing DRAM speed."
What is the impact of increasing I/O device speeds on system design and OS algorithms?,It increases pressure on I/O subsystems and OS algorithms to leverage the faster read/write speeds.
