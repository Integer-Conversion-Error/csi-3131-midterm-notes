Data movement for I/O operations can be managed by which two primary mechanisms?,User applications or network protocols,System calls or library functions,CPU (programmed I/O) or DMA controller,Interrupt handlers or signal processors,Caching mechanisms or buffering techniques,C,The text indicates 'Data movement: CPU (programmed I/O) or DMA controller'.
What is a device driver primarily defined as?,A user-level application for hardware diagnostics,A kernel module responsible for controlling a specific device,A hardware component that manages I/O operations,A network protocol used for device communication,A file system component for storing device configurations,B,The text defines 'Device driver' as a 'kernel module controlling a device'.
Which of the following is NOT listed as a basic hardware category handled by the system-call interface?,Block devices,Network sockets,Character-stream devices,Graphics processing units (GPUs),Programmed interval timers,D,"The text lists 'block devices, character-stream devices, memory-mapped files, network sockets, programmed interval timers' as categories handled by the system-call interface. GPUs are not mentioned."
What is the typical behavior of system calls in relation to the process that invokes them?,They always execute in parallel with the process.,They usually block the process until completion.,They immediately return control to the process without waiting.,They always trigger an error if the process tries to sleep.,They are exclusively handled by user-level libraries.,B,The text mentions 'System calls usually block processes'.
Under what circumstances are nonblocking or asynchronous system calls typically used?,To ensure maximum process sleep time,For applications that require user interaction to pause,When kernel/applications must not sleep,To simplify the process of context switching,Only for non-critical background tasks,C,The text states 'nonblocking/asynchronous calls used by kernel/applications that must not sleep'.
Which of the following is a service provided by the kernel's I/O subsystem?,User interface design,I/O scheduling,Database indexing,Web server management,Application compilation,B,The text lists 'I/O scheduling' as one of the services provided by the kernel's I/O subsystem.
The kernel's I/O subsystem provides a comprehensive set of services. Which of the following lists accurately represents some of these services?,"Process creation, memory allocation, and CPU scheduling","File encryption, network routing, and graphic rendering","I/O scheduling, buffering, and error handling","User authentication, printer configuration, and sound mixing","Device driver development, application debugging, and system backup",C,"The text explicitly lists 'I/O scheduling, buffering, caching, spooling, device reservation, error handling' as services provided by the kernel's I/O subsystem. Option C correctly includes three of these."
What is the primary purpose of 'Name translation' in the context of I/O?,To convert binary data into human-readable text.,To connect hardware devices to symbolic file names.,To translate network addresses into IP addresses.,To encrypt and decrypt data for security purposes.,To optimize the performance of CPU caches.,B,The text states 'Name translation: connects hardware devices to symbolic file names'.
Name translation for I/O devices involves multiple mapping levels. Which sequence best describes these levels?,Physical addresses → character-string names → device drivers/addresses,Device drivers/addresses → physical addresses → character-string names,Character-string names → physical addresses → device drivers/addresses,Character-string names → device drivers/addresses → physical addresses,Physical addresses → device drivers/addresses → character-string names,D,The text specifies the mapping levels as 'character-string names → device drivers/addresses → physical addresses (I/O ports/bus controllers)'.
"Where can device name mapping occur, according to the provided text?",Only within the file-system name space (UNIX),Only within a separate device name space (MS-DOS),Within the file-system name space (UNIX) or a separate device name space (MS-DOS),Exclusively in the kernel's memory space,"Only at the hardware level, independent of the operating system",C,The text states 'Mapping can be within file-system name space (UNIX) or separate device name space (MS-DOS)'.
What is 'STREAMS' in the context of UNIX systems?,A method for inter-process communication via shared memory,A mechanism for dynamic assembly of driver code pipelines,A specific type of network file system protocol,A utility for managing background processes,A command-line interpreter for system administration,B,The text defines 'STREAMS' as a 'UNIX mechanism for dynamic assembly of driver code pipelines'.
"When drivers are stacked using mechanisms like STREAMS, how does data typically flow?","Only in one direction, from top to bottom",Randomly jumping between stacked drivers,Sequentially and bidirectionally,In parallel streams that merge at the end,Only during the initialization phase,C,"The text notes that when drivers are stacked, 'data passes sequentially and bidirectionally'."
"Which of the following is identified as a primary cost associated with I/O system calls, specifically due to crossing the kernel protection boundary?",Increased network latency,Context switching,Disk defragmentation,Memory leak detection,User interface rendering,B,The text lists 'Context switching (kernel protection boundary)' as a cost of I/O system calls.
A significant CPU/memory load cost associated with I/O system calls comes from what operation?,Frequent CPU clock frequency adjustments,Dynamic memory allocation for user applications,Data copying between kernel buffers and application space,Execution of graphics rendering pipelines,Pre-fetching instructions for future execution,C,The text explicitly states 'CPU/memory load for data copying (kernel buffers ↔ application space)' as a cost.
"Besides context switching and data copying, what other factor contributes to the high cost of I/O system calls?",The need for physical device maintenance,User-level library function calls,Signal/interrupt handling,Compiler optimization levels,The size of the system's hard drive,C,The text lists 'Signal/interrupt handling' as another factor contributing to the cost of I/O system calls.
