Which of the following best characterizes the 'sequential access' method?,Records are read and written using a block number parameter.,"Information is processed in a random, non-ordered fashion.","Information is processed strictly in order, one record after another.",It primarily relies on constructing an index for rapid lookups.,It requires the entire file to be loaded into memory before access.,C,"Sequential access processes 'Information processed in order, one record after another.' This is also confirmed in the glossary."
The sequential access method is conceptually based on which model of a file?,Disk model,Tape model,Memory model,Network stream model,Database table model,B,The text explicitly states that sequential access is 'Based on tape model of file.'
Which set of operations is typical for a sequential access file?,"read(n), write(n)","position_file(n), seek_block(m)","read_next(), write_next()","create_index(), search_index()","allocate_block(), deallocate_block()",C,Sequential access uses `read_next()` to read the next portion and `write_next()` to append and advance.
What is a primary characteristic of the 'direct access' method?,It processes information strictly from beginning to end.,It is most commonly used by text editors and compilers.,It allows programs to read and write records rapidly in no particular order.,It always requires a multi-level index structure.,It is inherently inefficient on random-access devices.,C,Direct access allows programs to 'read/write records rapidly in no particular order.' This is also confirmed in the glossary.
The direct access method is conceptually based on which model of a file?,Tape model,Network stream model,Disk model,Mainframe queue model,Optical disc model,C,Direct access is 'Based on disk model of file (disks allow random access).'
"In the context of direct access, what is meant by 'logical records'?",Records whose size can vary widely within the same file.,File contents logically designated as fixed-length structured data.,Temporary records used only for file system internal operations.,Records that are always stored contiguously on disk.,"Records that must be processed in a specific, predefined order.",B,"The glossary defines 'logical records' as 'File contents logically designated as fixed-length structured data,' and the direct access section mentions 'File: fixed-length logical records.'"
Which term is used as an alternative name for 'direct access'?,Sequential access,Indexed access,Relative access,Stream access,Pointer access,C,The text and glossary state that 'direct access' is also known as 'relative access'.
"When performing direct access operations, what does a 'relative block number' specify?",The physical sector address on the disk where the block is stored.,"The total number of blocks in the file, starting from 1.","An index relative to the beginning of the file, with the first block often being 0.",A unique identifier for the file within the entire file system.,"The block's size in bytes, relative to a standard block size.",C,The glossary defines 'relative block number' as 'Index relative to beginning of file (first is block 0).'
What is the 'allocation problem' in the context of file access?,The challenge of assigning unique file IDs to new files.,The operating system's determination of where to store file blocks.,The difficulty in allocating enough memory for file caching.,The process of allocating user permissions to access files.,The issue of allocating network bandwidth for file transfers.,B,The glossary defines 'allocation problem' as 'OS determination of where to store file blocks.'
Why does the use of 'relative block numbers' in direct access help prevent users from accessing non-file portions of the file system?,Because relative block numbers are encrypted and cannot be deciphered by users.,"Because the OS transparently translates them to physical addresses, controlling access.",Because users are only allowed to specify absolute physical disk addresses.,"Because relative block numbers are only used for read operations, not write.",Because they enforce a strict sequential access pattern.,B,The text states that the OS deciding file placement ('allocation problem') using relative block numbers 'Prevents user from accessing non-file portions of file system.'
Simulating direct access on a sequential-access file system is characterized as:,Highly efficient and straightforward.,A common practice for performance optimization.,Extremely inefficient and clumsy.,Impossible due to fundamental differences in access patterns.,Only possible if the sequential file is sorted.,C,"The text explicitly states, 'Simulating direct-access on sequential-access: extremely inefficient and clumsy.'"
"What is the foundation upon which 'Other Access Methods', such as indexed access, are typically built?",Tape-based sequential access.,Network stream access.,Direct access method.,In-memory file system caching.,User-defined custom algorithms.,C,The text states that 'Other Access Methods' are 'Built on top of direct-access method.'
What is the primary purpose of an 'index' in file access methods?,To compress the file data to save storage space.,"To store metadata about the file, such as creation date and owner.","To provide pointers to various blocks within a file, enabling direct access.",To enforce security permissions for different users.,To log all read and write operations performed on the file.,C,"The text states, 'Index: contains pointers to various blocks (like book index),' and the glossary defines it as containing 'pointers to contents.'"
"For very large files, when the main index itself becomes too large to fit in memory, what is the suggested solution?",To switch to a purely sequential access method.,"To divide the file into multiple smaller, independent files.",To build an index for the index file (multi-level indexing).,"To store the index in a high-speed, persistent memory device.",To perform a full file scan for every access request.,C,The text states the solution is an 'index for the index file (primary index -> secondary index -> data).'
"In a multi-level indexing system like IBM ISAM, what is the maximum number of direct-access reads typically required to locate any record?",One,Two,Three,Four,Depends on the number of indexing levels,B,"The text states, 'Any record located by at most two direct-access reads.'"
Which of the following is cited as a common application type that benefits from 'direct access' due to its need for immediate access to large information amounts?,Text editors,Compilers,Streaming video players,Airline reservation systems (databases),Backup and archiving utilities,D,"The text states, 'Great use for immediate access to large info amounts (e.g., databases). Example: airline reservation system.'"
Which statement is true regarding the support for sequential and direct access by operating systems?,All operating systems fully support both sequential and direct access.,No operating systems support both sequential and direct access simultaneously.,"Some operating systems do not support both, and some require file definition at creation.",Direct access is always preferred over sequential access in modern OS.,"Sequential access can only be used on tape devices, and direct access only on disks.",C,"The text states, 'Not all OS support both sequential and direct access. Some require file defined as sequential/direct at creation.'"
How is a request for record 'N' in a direct access file with fixed-length logical records typically satisfied?,By reading records sequentially until the Nth record is reached.,By converting it into an I/O request for 'N' bytes starting at the beginning of the file.,By converting it into an I/O request for 'N' bytes starting at 'N * (logical record length)'.,By searching an in-memory table for the physical address of record 'N'.,By creating a temporary index for the file to locate record 'N'.,C,"The text states, 'Satisfying request for record N: turned into I/O request for N bytes starting at N * (logical record length).'"
What is one way systems can provide alternative operations for direct access while retaining sequential-like functions?,By removing `read_next()` and `write_next()` entirely.,By only supporting `read(n)` and `write(n)`.,By adding `position_file(n)` while retaining `read_next()` and `write_next()`.,By always requiring an index to be built first.,By converting direct access requests into sequential reads internally.,C,"The text states, 'Alternative: retain `read_next()`, `write_next()`, add `position_file(n)`.'"
