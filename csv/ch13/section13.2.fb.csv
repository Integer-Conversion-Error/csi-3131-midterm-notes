Front,Back
What is the fundamental requirement for using information stored in files?,Information stored in files must be accessed and read into memory.
How many access methods do systems typically provide for file information?,"Some systems provide only one access method, while others provide many."
What is a major design problem related to file access methods?,Choosing the right access method.
Define: sequential access,"File-access method: contents read in order, beginning to end."
What is the simplest file access method?,Sequential access.
Describe how information is processed using sequential access.,"Information is processed in order, one record after another."
What are common applications that use sequential access?,Editors and compilers.
What is the function of the `read_next()` operation in sequential access?,It reads the next portion of the file and automatically advances the file pointer.
What is the function of the `write_next()` operation in sequential access?,It appends new material to the end of the file and advances the file pointer to the end of the newly written material.
Can a file using sequential access be reset?,"Yes, a file using sequential access can be reset to the beginning."
Do all sequential access systems allow skipping records?,Some systems allow skipping forward or backward `n` records.
What model of file is sequential access based on?,The tape model of a file.
On what types of devices does sequential access work?,It works on both sequential-access devices and random-access ones.
Define: direct access,File-access method: contents read in random order.
Define: relative access,File-access method: contents read in random order.
What is another name for direct access?,Relative access.
Define: logical records,File contents logically designated as fixed-length structured data.
How are files structured in direct access?,Files are structured as fixed-length logical records.
How do programs read/write records using direct access?,Programs can read or write records rapidly in no particular order.
What model of file is direct access based on?,The disk model of a file (as disks allow random access).
How is a file viewed in direct access?,As a numbered sequence of blocks or records.
Are there restrictions on read/write order in direct access?,"No, there are no restrictions on read/write order."
What is a significant use case for direct access?,"Immediate access to large amounts of information, such as in databases (e.g., an airline reservation system)."
How do direct-access file operations typically specify the target location?,"They include a block number as a parameter (e.g., `read(n)`, `write(n)`)."
What is an alternative way to implement direct access operations while retaining sequential-like operations?,Retain `read_next()` and `write_next()` and add a `position_file(n)` operation.
Define: relative block number,Index relative to beginning of file (first is block 0).
What is the starting index for relative block numbers in many systems?,"0 (the first block is 0, the next is 1, etc.). Some systems start at 1."
Define: allocation problem,OS determination of where to store file blocks.
What is a benefit of the OS handling the allocation problem for direct access?,It prevents the user from accidentally accessing non-file portions of the file system.
How does the OS satisfy a request for a record `N` in a direct-access file?,It turns it into an I/O request for `N` bytes starting at `N * (logical record length)`.
"What makes it easy to read, write, or delete a record in direct access?",Logical records are of fixed size.
Do all operating systems support both sequential and direct access?,"No, not all operating systems support both."
When might a file's access method be defined?,Some systems require a file to be defined as sequential or direct at its creation.
How can sequential access be simulated on a direct-access file?,By keeping a `cp` variable for the current position.
What is the efficiency of simulating direct access on a sequential-access file?,It is extremely inefficient and clumsy.
What are other file access methods typically built upon?,Direct-access method.
Define: index (in the context of file access),"An access method built on direct access, where a file contains an index with pointers to its contents."
What is a core component of file access methods built on direct access?,An index constructed for the file.
What does an index contain in the context of file access?,"Pointers to various blocks of the file, similar to a book index."
How is a record found using an index-based access method?,"Search the index, then use the pointer to access the file directly."
Give an example of how an index might be structured for a sorted file.,"For a retail-price file sorted by UPC, the index might contain the first UPC in each block."
What is the process for finding a block using a simple index kept in memory?,"Perform a binary search on the index to find the relevant block, then access that block."
What challenge arises when index files become too large?,The index file itself might be too large to fit in memory.
How is the challenge of large index files addressed?,"By creating an index for the index file (e.g., a primary index pointing to secondary indexes, which then point to the data)."
What is an example of an indexed sequential-access method?,IBM ISAM (Indexed Sequential-Access Method).
Describe the structure of IBM ISAM indexes.,"A small main index points to disk blocks of a secondary index, and the secondary index blocks then point to the actual file blocks."
What is a requirement for the file data in IBM ISAM?,The file must be sorted on a key.
Outline the steps to find an item using IBM ISAM.,1. Perform a binary search on the main index. 2. Get the appropriate secondary index block. 3. Perform a binary search on the secondary index. 4. Find the block containing the record. 5. Perform a sequential search within that block.
What is the maximum number of direct-access reads typically required to locate any record using an indexed sequential-access method like ISAM?,At most two direct-access reads.
