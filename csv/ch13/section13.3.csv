Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
What is the primary function of a directory in a file system?,To store the actual data content of files.,To manage the physical disk blocks allocated to files.,To act as a symbol table translating file names to file control blocks.,To execute user commands and system programs.,To serve as a temporary storage area for recently accessed files.,C,"A directory functions as a symbol table, mapping human-readable file names to their corresponding file control blocks (FCBs) which contain detailed information about the files."
Which of the following is NOT a fundamental capability that a directory organization must allow?,Inserting new entries.,Deleting existing entries.,Searching for a named entry.,Compressing directory size automatically.,Listing all entries within the directory.,D,"Fundamental capabilities for a directory organization include inserting, deleting, searching for, and listing entries. Automatic compression is not listed as a required basic capability."
"When deleting a file from a directory, what potential issue might arise that requires defragmentation?",The file's data blocks might become corrupted.,The directory entry might become read-only.,It may leave a 'hole' in the directory structure.,The file's timestamp might be reset incorrectly.,It automatically creates a backup of the deleted file.,C,"Deleting a file can leave a 'hole' in the directory structure, which may necessitate defragmentation to optimize space utilization and performance."
What is the primary purpose of 'Traversing the file system' as a directory operation?,To create new files and directories.,To change the permissions of files.,To find and display the contents of a single specific file.,"To access every directory and file, often for backup or space release.",To rename files based on their content.,D,"Traversing the file system involves accessing all directories and files, a process typically performed for tasks like creating backups or identifying space that can be released."
What is the main limitation of a single-level directory structure when multiple users are present?,It is difficult to support and understand.,"Files must have unique names across all users, leading to name collisions.",It requires complex permissions management for file sharing.,It offers poor performance for file search operations.,Only a single type of file can be stored in the directory.,B,"In a single-level directory, all files reside in the same directory, meaning every file must have a unique name, which quickly leads to name collision problems when multiple users are involved."
"In a two-level directory system, what is a User File Directory (UFD)?",A system directory that stores critical OS files.,A directory that is shared among all users for common files.,A per-user directory that contains only that user's files.,A temporary directory for caching frequently accessed files.,The root directory of the entire file system.,C,"The User File Directory (UFD) is a separate directory created for each user in a two-level directory system, containing only their specific files."
What is the role of the Main File Directory (MFD) in a two-level directory structure?,It stores the actual data blocks of all user files.,"It is an index, typically by user name or account, that points to each user's UFD.",It contains a list of all executable system programs.,It serves as a cache for recently accessed directory entries.,It manages the network connections for file sharing.,B,"The Main File Directory (MFD) acts as a top-level index, usually organized by user name or account, with each entry pointing to the respective User File Directory (UFD)."
A significant advantage of a two-level directory structure over a single-level directory is that:,It allows for unlimited nesting of subdirectories.,It enables different users to have files with the same name.,It automatically performs garbage collection for deleted files.,It eliminates the need for any form of path names.,It inherently supports shared files without links.,B,"Because each user has their own UFD, different users can have files with identical names (e.g., 'report.txt') without causing name collisions, as long as the names are unique within their respective UFDs."
"In a two-level directory system, how is a file typically referred to if it belongs to another user?",By its unique file ID only.,By simply changing the current directory to the other user's UFD.,By specifying both the user name and the file name.,By directly accessing the Main File Directory (MFD).,It is not possible to access another user's file.,C,"To access another user's file in a two-level directory system, the file must be specified using both the user's name and the file's name, forming a path name like `/userb/test.txt`."
"What is a 'search path' in the context of directory systems, especially useful for system files in a two-level structure?",The route taken by a user to manually locate a file.,A sequence of directories that the operating system searches to locate an executable file.,The unique identifier assigned to each file for fast retrieval.,A graphical representation of the file system hierarchy.,A list of recently accessed files for quick reopening.,B,"A 'search path' defines the sequence of directories that the operating system traverses when trying to locate a file, particularly executable files, often starting with the local user directory and then proceeding to shared system directories."
Which directory structure is considered a generalization of the two-level directory and is the most common in modern operating systems?,Single-level directory.,Flat directory.,Tree-structured directory.,Acyclic-graph directory.,General graph directory.,C,"Tree-structured directories extend the concept of the two-level directory by allowing directories to be nested to an arbitrary height, forming a hierarchical tree. This is the most common directory structure."
"In a tree-structured directory system, how is a directory (or subdirectory) often identified or treated?",It's treated as a special type of executable program.,"It's considered a special file, often with a bit defining it as a directory versus a regular file.",It's a fixed-size partition of the disk.,It's a temporary structure that gets deleted after each session.,It's a physical hardware component.,B,"In tree-structured directories, a directory is frequently treated as a special type of file, where one bit in its entry indicates whether it's a regular file (0) or a subdirectory (1)."
What is an 'absolute path name' in a tree-structured directory system?,A path that defines the location of a file relative to the current directory.,A path that identifies a file using only its unique file ID.,A path that begins at the root directory and specifies the full hierarchy to the file.,A path used exclusively for network file access.,A path that automatically adjusts if the file is moved.,C,"An absolute path name starts from the file system's root directory (e.g., '/') and lists all directories in the hierarchy down to the target file, providing a unique and unambiguous location."
"If your current directory is `/home/user/documents` in a tree-structured file system, what would the relative path `reports/monthly.pdf` refer to?",`reports/monthly.pdf` in the root directory.,`/home/user/documents/reports/monthly.pdf`.,`/reports/monthly.pdf`.,The `monthly.pdf` file in the user's home directory.,The `reports` directory at the same level as `/home`.,B,"A relative path name defines the path from the current directory. So, `reports/monthly.pdf` relative to `/home/user/documents` translates to `/home/user/documents/reports/monthly.pdf`."
Which statement accurately describes a common policy for deleting non-empty directories in tree-structured file systems?,All systems automatically delete a directory and its contents recursively.,Most systems require manual confirmation for each file before deletion.,"Some systems only allow deletion if the directory is empty, others allow recursive deletion (e.g., UNIX `rm -r`).","Non-empty directories can only be renamed, not deleted.",Directory deletion is strictly prohibited to prevent data loss.,C,"Deletion policies vary: some systems require a directory to be empty before it can be deleted, forcing the user to delete contents manually, while others (like UNIX `rm -r`) offer a convenient but potentially dangerous recursive deletion."
What is the defining characteristic that acyclic-graph directories introduce compared to tree-structured directories?,They enforce unique file names globally.,They allow directories to share subdirectories and files.,They are limited to two levels of hierarchy.,They strictly prevent any form of file sharing.,They only store temporary files.,B,"Acyclic-graph directories are a more flexible structure that allows multiple directories to point to and share the same subdirectory or file, unlike tree structures where each file/directory has only one parent."
"When a file is shared using an acyclic-graph directory structure, what is true about modifications to its content?",Changes are only visible through the original directory entry.,A separate copy of the file is created for each shared instance.,"Changes made via any shared link are visible to all other links, as there is only one actual file.",The file becomes read-only to prevent inconsistencies.,Only the administrator can modify shared files.,C,"In an acyclic-graph directory, when a file is shared, there is only one physical file on disk. Any modifications made through any of its linked entries will be immediately visible through all other entries pointing to that same file."
"In the context of acyclic-graph directories, what is a 'link'?",A physical connection between two hard drives.,A pointer within a directory entry to another file or subdirectory.,A cryptographic key used for file encryption.,A system command used to create new directories.,A backup copy of a file.,B,"A 'link' in acyclic-graph directories is a pointer (which can be an absolute or relative path name) within one directory entry that refers to another file or subdirectory, enabling sharing."
What does the operation 'resolve' mean in the context of file system links?,To fix errors in a file's content.,To delete a broken link from the directory.,To follow the path name specified in a link to locate the actual target file.,To change the permissions of a linked file.,To convert a relative path to an absolute path.,C,To 'resolve' a link means to use the path name stored within the link itself to find and access the actual file or directory that the link points to.
What is 'aliasing' a problem in acyclic-graph directories?,It prevents files from being deleted.,It refers to the situation where the same file can be accessed via multiple distinct absolute path names.,It causes system slowdowns due to excessive memory usage.,It changes the file's content without user permission.,It restricts files to be accessed by only one user at a time.,B,"Aliasing is a problem in acyclic-graph directories because a single file or subdirectory can be pointed to by multiple links, resulting in it having several different absolute path names, which can be confusing for users."
"What problem can arise if a file linked in an acyclic-graph directory is deleted without proper management (e.g., if it's a symbolic link and the original is deleted)?",The directory structure automatically converts to a tree.,The remaining links to the file become 'dangling pointers'.,The entire file system crashes due to inconsistency.,The file is automatically restored from a backup.,All other users are immediately logged out.,B,"If a file that has symbolic links pointing to it is deleted, the symbolic links themselves remain but now point to a non-existent file, becoming 'dangling pointers'."
How do systems like UNIX manage space deallocation for 'hard links' in acyclic-graph directories to prevent dangling pointers?,By automatically creating a backup copy when a link is deleted.,"By using a 'reference count' to track the number of links to a file, deleting the file only when the count reaches zero.",By converting all hard links to symbolic links upon deletion.,By requiring manual confirmation from all users before deleting any linked file.,By storing copies of the file in every directory it's linked to.,B,"Hard links, often used in UNIX-like systems, employ a 'reference count' (or link count). This count is incremented when a new link is created and decremented when a link is deleted. The actual file's space is only deallocated when its reference count drops to zero, ensuring no dangling pointers."
What is the defining characteristic of a 'general graph directory' that differentiates it from an 'acyclic-graph directory'?,It uses only absolute path names.,It does not allow any files to be shared.,It allows cycles (loops) in the directory structure.,It is limited to a single level of directories.,It requires all files to have unique names globally.,C,"The key distinction of a general graph directory is that it permits cycles or loops within the directory structure, meaning a directory can contain a link that eventually leads back to an ancestor directory or itself."
What is a major problem introduced by cycles in a general graph directory structure during file system traversal or search operations?,Inability to find any files.,Automatic file corruption.,Risk of infinite loops during traversal.,Reduced storage capacity of the disk.,Increased network latency.,C,"The presence of cycles in a general graph directory can lead to infinite loops if traversal algorithms don't specifically account for and bypass them, potentially causing the system to hang or crash during operations like search or backup."
Why is space deallocation (like determining when a file can be truly deleted) more complex in general graph directories than in acyclic-graph directories?,All files are automatically backed up before deletion.,"The presence of cycles means a reference count might not reach zero even if the file is inaccessible, requiring garbage collection.",Users must manually specify deallocation for each block.,Deletion is only allowed at specific times of the day.,There is no mechanism for tracking file references.,B,"In general graph directories, a file or directory might become inaccessible (no valid path from the root leads to it), but its reference count might not drop to zero due to cycles. This requires a more complex 'garbage collection' process to identify and reclaim truly unreachable space."
What is 'garbage collection' in the context of general graph directories?,A process of deleting temporary files to free up space.,A mechanism for automatically repairing corrupted file data.,"The recovery of space containing no-longer-valid data, especially when reference counts don't suffice due to cycles.",A system utility for creating backup copies of the entire file system.,The process of reorganizing disk blocks for better performance.,C,"Garbage collection refers to the process of identifying and recovering disk space occupied by data that is no longer accessible or valid, even if traditional reference counts (which can be problematic with cycles) don't indicate it."
