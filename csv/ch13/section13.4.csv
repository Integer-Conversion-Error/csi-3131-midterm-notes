Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
Which concept primarily addresses the issue of physical damage to information by methods like duplicate copies and backups?,Protection,Authentication,Reliability,Encryption,Firewalling,C,"Reliability, often achieved through duplicate copies and backups, is the concept associated with protecting information from physical damage."
What is the main concern addressed by 'protection' in the context of information safety?,Data loss due to hardware failure,Ensuring data integrity during transmission,Preventing improper access to information,Protecting against natural disasters,Optimizing storage space usage,C,The text states that 'protection' is concerned with 'Improper access'.
Which of the following is NOT explicitly listed as a protection mechanism in the text?,User name/password authentication,Encrypting secondary storage,Firewalling network access,Regular antivirus scans,Advanced mechanisms for valid data access in multiuser systems,D,"User name/password authentication, encrypting secondary storage, firewalling network access, and advanced mechanisms for valid data access in multiuser systems are all listed protection mechanisms. Regular antivirus scans are not explicitly mentioned."
Which file access operation is defined as 'Write or rewrite file'?,Read,Execute,Append,Write,Attribute change,D,The 'Write' operation is explicitly defined as 'Write or rewrite file'.
"If a user needs to add new information to the end of an existing file without altering its current content, which file operation should they use?",Write,Read,Execute,Append,Delete,D,The 'Append' operation is defined as 'Write new info at end of file'.
Where is protection typically applied for higher-level functions such as 'rename' or 'copy'?,"At the user interface level, by disabling the functions for unauthorized users.","Within the application layer, using custom access checks.",At the lower-level system calls that implement these functions.,Through external security audits and compliance checks.,Via hardware-enforced memory protection units.,C,"The text states, 'Higher-level functions (rename, copy, edit) often implemented by system programs using lower-level calls. Protection at lower level.'"
What is the 'most general scheme' for access control where access is dependent on user identity?,Password authentication,Role-Based Access Control (RBAC),Access-Control List (ACL),Discretionary Access Control (DAC),Mandatory Access Control (MAC),C,The text explicitly states: 'Most general scheme: access-control list (ACL)'.
Which of the following is identified as a disadvantage of using a general Access-Control List (ACL) scheme?,It limits the complexity of access methodologies.,"It results in fixed-size directory entries, wasting space.","The lists can be lengthy and tedious to construct, especially if users are unknown.",It requires less frequent updates compared to other methods.,It does not allow for fine-grained control over file access.,C,"The text lists 'Lengthy lists (tedious to construct, especially if users unknown)' as a disadvantage of ACLs."
"In the condensed ACL classification scheme, which category refers to 'All other users' who are not the owner or part of a specific group?",Guest,Public,Universe,Other,Default,D,The condensed ACL scheme defines 'Other' as 'All other users'.
"In UNIX permissions, what does 'rwx' signify for a user category (e.g., owner, group, or other)?",Read and Write permissions only.,"Read, Write, and Execute permissions.",Rewrite and Execute permissions only.,"Read, Execute, and Delete permissions.","Rename, Write, and Execute permissions.",B,"The text states that 'rwx' stands for 'read, write, execute' in UNIX permissions."
"When ACLs are combined with regular permissions in Solaris, how is the presence of an ACL indicated?",A special character like '@' prefixes the permissions.,The permission string is enclosed in square brackets.,A plus sign ('+') is appended to the regular permissions.,The permissions are displayed in a different color.,A separate column explicitly states 'ACL Present'.,C,"Solaris indicates ACLs by appending a '+' to regular permissions (e.g., `-rw-r--r--+`)."
"When ACLs are combined with traditional UNIX-like permissions, which typically takes precedence in determining access rights?","Owner permissions, as they are the most specific.","Group permissions, as they apply to a set of users.","ACLs, due to their specificity.","Other (universe) permissions, as they are the least restrictive.",The most restrictive permission set applied to the user.,C,"The text states, 'Precedence: ACLs typically take precedence over group permissions (specificity priority)'."
What is a major disadvantage of using a single password for all files in a system that relies on passwords with each file for protection?,It requires users to remember an excessive number of passwords.,It only allows read-only access to the files.,"It provides an 'all-or-none' protection, making all files vulnerable if that single password is compromised.",It is less efficient than authenticating users with a username.,It does not allow for varying access rights between different files.,C,"The text identifies 'single password for all files (all-or-none protection)' as a disadvantage, meaning the security of all files rests on that one password."
"In multilevel directory structures, what additional aspect does directory protection control besides the creation and deletion of files within the directory?",The encryption method for files in the directory.,The frequency of backups for the directory's contents.,The user's ability to determine a file's existence by listing directory contents.,The physical disk location of the directory.,The maximum size of files that can be stored in the directory.,C,Directory protection also controls 'Control user's ability to determine file existence (listing directory contents)'.
"If a user wants to access a file by its path name in a multilevel directory structure, what access rights are necessary?",Only read access to the file itself.,Only execute access to the directory containing the file.,Access to both the directory and the file.,Write access to the directory and read access to the file.,Administrator privileges for the entire system.,C,"The text states, 'If path name refers to file, user needs access to both directory and file'."
