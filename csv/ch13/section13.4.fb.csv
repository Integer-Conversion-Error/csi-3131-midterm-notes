Front,Back
What aspect of information safety addresses physical damage?,"Reliability (e.g., duplicate copies, backups)."
What aspect of information safety addresses improper access?,Protection.
List common protection mechanisms.,"User name/password authentication, encrypting secondary storage, firewalling network access, and advanced mechanisms for valid data access in multiuser systems."
What is the 'Read' operation in file access control?,Reading from a file.
What is the 'Write' operation in file access control?,Writing or rewriting a file.
What is the 'Execute' operation in file access control?,Loading and executing a file.
What is the 'Append' operation in file access control?,Writing new information at the end of a file.
What is the 'Delete' operation in file access control?,Deleting a file and freeing its space.
What is the 'List' operation in file access control?,Listing a file's name and attributes.
What is the 'Attribute change' operation in file access control?,Changing a file's attributes.
"Where is protection typically implemented for higher-level functions (like rename, copy, edit) that use lower-level calls?",At the lower-level calls.
"What is the most general scheme for access control, where access depends on user identity?",Access-control list (ACL).
Define 'Access-control list (ACL)'.,A list that specifies user names and the allowed access types for a file. The OS checks this list to determine access.
What are the advantages of using an Access-control list (ACL)?,It allows for complex access methodologies.
What are the disadvantages of using an Access-control list (ACL)?,"Lengthy lists (tedious to construct, especially if users are unknown) and variable-size directory entries (complicating space management)."
"In condensed Access-control lists (ACLs), what are the three user classifications?","Owner, Group, and Other."
Who is classified as the 'Owner' in condensed ACLs?,The user who created the file.
Who is classified as the 'Group' in condensed ACLs?,A set of users sharing a file and needing similar access.
Who is classified as 'Other' in condensed ACLs?,All other users not classified as Owner or Group.
What is a common approach to access control combining ACLs and user classifications?,"Combining ACLs with owner, group, and universe schemes (e.g., as seen in Solaris)."
"How many fields do UNIX permissions typically use, and what are they?","Three fields: owner, group, and universe (or others)."
How are UNIX permissions represented for each field?,"Three bits, typically 'rwx'."
What does 'r' stand for in UNIX 'rwx' permissions?,Read.
What does 'w' stand for in UNIX 'rwx' permissions?,Write.
What does 'x' stand for in UNIX 'rwx' permissions?,Execution.
"In a UNIX file listing, what does 'd' as the first character indicate?",It indicates a subdirectory.
How does Solaris show that optional ACLs are present on a file?,"A '+' is appended to the regular permissions string (e.g., '-rw-r--r--+')."
What commands are used to manage ACLs in systems like Solaris?,setfacl and getfacl.
How does Windows manage ACLs?,Through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
"When both ACLs and group permissions are present, which typically takes precedence?",ACLs typically take precedence over group permissions due to specificity priority.
What is an alternative protection approach involving passwords and files?,Associating a password with each file.
When is associating a password with each file effective?,If passwords are random and changed often.
What are the disadvantages of associating a password with each file?,"Users have too many passwords to remember, or using a single password for all files results in all-or-none protection."
What is a more common approach than associating passwords with individual files for large-scale protection?,"Encryption of partitions or files, managed with a key password."
What aspects does directory protection in multilevel structures control?,Control over creation/deletion of files in the directory and control over a user's ability to determine file existence (listing directory contents).
"If a path name refers to a file, what access is needed for the user to access that file?",The user needs access to both the directory (or directories in the path) and the file itself.
"In acyclic/general graphs (referring to directory structures), how do access rights vary?",Access rights can be different depending on the path name used to refer to a file.
