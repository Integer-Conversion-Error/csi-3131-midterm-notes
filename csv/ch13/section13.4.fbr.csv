How is information safety addressed against physical damage?,"Through reliability, which involves duplicate copies and backups.",y
How is information safety addressed against improper access?,Through protection mechanisms.,y
List common protection mechanisms.,"User name/password authentication, encrypting secondary storage, firewalling network access, and advanced mechanisms for valid data access in multiuser systems.",y
Define the 'Read' file access operation.,To read from a file.,y
Define the 'Write' file access operation.,To write or rewrite a file.,y
Define the 'Execute' file access operation.,To load and execute a file.,y
Define the 'Append' file access operation.,To write new information at the end of a file.,y
Define the 'Delete' file access operation.,To delete a file and free its space.,y
Define the 'List' file access operation.,To list a file's name and attributes.,y

"How are higher-level file functions (e.g., rename, copy, edit) typically implemented, and at what level is protection applied?","They are often implemented by system programs using lower-level calls, with protection applied at the lower level.",y
On what is file access typically dependent?,User identity.,y
What is the most general scheme for access control?,Access-control list (ACL).,y
What information does an Access-Control List (ACL) specify?,User names and their allowed access types.,y
How does an Operating System (OS) use an ACL to grant or deny access?,"The OS checks the ACL; if a user is listed with the requested access type, it allows access, otherwise it denies.",y
What is an advantage of using Access-Control Lists (ACLs)?,They support complex access methodologies.,y
What are the disadvantages of Access-Control Lists (ACLs)?,"Lengthy lists (tedious to construct, especially if users are unknown) and variable-size directory entries (leading to complicated space management).",y
"In condensed ACLs, define 'Owner'.",The user who created the file.,y
"In condensed ACLs, define 'Group'.",A set of users sharing a file who need similar access.,y
"In condensed ACLs, define 'Other'.",All other users (not owner or in the group).,y
What is a common approach for access control that combines different schemes?,"Combining Access-Control Lists (ACLs) with an owner, group, and universe scheme (e.g., as seen in Solaris).",y
Describe the structure of UNIX permissions.,"UNIX permissions consist of three fields: owner, group, and universe. Each field uses three bits (`rwx`) to represent read, write, and execute permissions respectively.",y
"In UNIX permissions, what do 'r', 'w', and 'x' stand for?","'r' stands for read, 'w' for write, and 'x' for execution.",y
What does 'd' as the first character in a UNIX permission string indicate?,It indicates a subdirectory.,y
What does a UNIX permission string like `rwxrwxr--` signify?,"It signifies `rwx` permissions (read, write, execute) for the owner, `rw-` permissions (read, write, no execute) for the group, and `r--` permissions (read-only) for others.",y
What user interface challenge arises when combining ACLs with regular permissions?,How to visibly indicate the presence of optional ACLs.,y
How does Solaris indicate the presence of ACLs alongside regular permissions?,"By appending a `+` symbol to the regular permission string (e.g., `-rw-r--r--+`).",y
What commands are used to manage ACLs in systems like Solaris?,Commands such as `setfacl` and `getfacl`.,y
How does Windows manage ACLs?,Through a Graphical User Interface (GUI).,y
"When ACLs and group permissions conflict, which typically takes precedence?",ACLs typically take precedence over group permissions due to specificity priority.,y
What is a potential advantage of using a password with each file for protection?,It can be effective if passwords are random and changed often.,y
What are the disadvantages of using a password with each file for protection?,"Users would have too many passwords to remember, and if a single password is used for all files, it results in all-or-none protection.",y
How do some systems implement password protection for groups of files?,By associating a password with a subdirectory.,y
What is a more common approach to file protection involving passwords today?,"Encryption of partitions or files, managed with key passwords.",y
What aspects does directory protection control in multilevel structures?,"It controls the creation and deletion of files within the directory, and a user's ability to determine file existence (by listing directory contents).",y
What access is required if a path name refers to a file in a multilevel directory structure?,The user needs access to both the directory and the file itself.,y
"How might access rights vary in multilevel directory structures, particularly with acyclic or general graphs?",Access rights can vary depending on the specific path name used to refer to a file.,y
"Define ""access-control list"" (ACL).",A list of user names allowed to access a file.,y
