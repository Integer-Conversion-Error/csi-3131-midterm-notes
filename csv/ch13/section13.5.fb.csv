What is memory mapping in the context of file access?,An alternative file access method where a file's I/O is treated as routine memory accesses using virtual memory techniques.
What is a key benefit of using memory-mapped files?,It can lead to significant performance increases by simplifying and speeding up file access.
How does memory mapping conceptually link a file to memory?,It maps a disk block to one or more pages in memory.
What happens upon initial access to a memory-mapped file?,"It triggers demand paging, resulting in a page fault."
What is read into physical memory during the initial access of a memory-mapped file?,A page-sized portion of the file is read into a physical page.
How are subsequent reads/writes to a memory-mapped file handled?,They are handled as routine memory accesses.
How do memory-mapped files simplify and speed up file access?,By avoiding `read()` and `write()` system call overhead.
Are writes to a memory-mapped file immediately reflected on secondary storage?,"No, writes to a memory-mapped file are not necessarily immediate to secondary storage."
When are updates to a memory-mapped file generally written back to secondary storage?,"Generally, updates are written back when the file is closed."
What can happen to intermediate changes in a memory-mapped file under memory pressure?,"Under memory pressure, intermediate changes may go to swap space."
"How do some operating systems, like Solaris, handle all file I/O?","Some OS (e.g., Solaris) memory-map all file I/O, even with standard calls, to kernel address space."
Can multiple processes map the same file concurrently using memory mapping?,"Yes, multiple processes can map the same file concurrently for data sharing."
"If multiple processes map the same memory-mapped file, are writes by one process visible to others?","Yes, writes by one process are visible to others mapping the same section."
How is data sharing via memory-mapped files implemented at a low level?,It is implemented by a virtual memory map pointing to the same physical page.
Does memory mapping support copy-on-write functionality?,"Yes, it supports copy-on-write, allowing processes to share read-only data and get their own copies for modification."
What mechanism should processes use for shared data coordination when using memory-mapped files?,Processes should use mutual exclusion for shared data coordination.
How is shared memory often implemented?,Shared memory is often implemented by memory mapping files.
What are the two main steps to implement shared memory using memory-mapped files in the Windows API?,1. Create a file mapping for the file. 2. Establish a view of the mapped file in the process's virtual address space.
How does a second process access shared memory established via memory-mapped files in Windows?,The second process opens and creates a view of the same mapped file.
What does a mapped file act as in the context of Windows API shared memory?,A mapped file acts as a shared-memory object for inter-process communication.
Provide an example use case for shared memory implemented with memory-mapped files.,"Producer writes, Consumer reads (classic inter-process communication example)."
What Windows API call is used to open a file when setting up memory-mapped shared memory?,`CreateFile()` (returns `HANDLE`)
What Windows API call is used to create a file mapping object after opening the file?,`CreateFileMapping()` (uses file `HANDLE`)
What Windows API call is used to establish a view of the mapped file in the process's virtual address space?,`MapViewOfFile()` (uses mapped object `HANDLE`)
What does `CreateFileMapping()` create that allows multiple processes to access the shared memory?,"A named shared-memory object (e.g., `SharedObject`)."
"What does `MapViewOfFile()` return, and how are accesses to it handled?",It returns a pointer to the shared-memory object; accesses to this memory are accesses to the file.
"Can only the entire file be mapped using memory mapping, or just a portion?",The entire file or a portion can be mapped.
How are mapped files handled with respect to paging?,A mapped file may be demand-paged.
What Windows API call is used to remove a view of a memory-mapped file?,`UnmapViewOfFile()`.
"Define ""memory mapping"" (file access method).",File-access method where a file is mapped into a process's memory space for direct memory access.
"In Windows, what is ""file mapping""?",The first step in memory-mapping a file.
"In Windows, define ""view"" in the context of memory-mapped files.",An address range mapped in shared memory; the second step in memory-mapping a file.
"In the Windows API, what is a ""named shared-memory object""?",A section of a memory-mapped file accessible by name from multiple processes.
