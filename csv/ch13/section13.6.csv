Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
"According to the text, what is a file characterized as?",A physical block on a hard disk,An abstract data type consisting of a sequence of logical records,A collection of executable programs,A temporary storage area for system processes,A hardware component responsible for data storage,B,"The text states: 'File: abstract data type, sequence of logical records (byte, line, complex data).'"
What is a primary task of the Operating System (OS) concerning files?,To create new application programs,To manage network traffic for remote users,To map the logical file concept to physical storage,To perform garbage collection for all memory spaces,To encrypt all data before it's stored,C,"The text states: 'OS task: map logical file concept to physical storage (hard disk, NVM).'"
"Regarding file record types, who primarily supports them or leaves the support to the application?",The user directly,The compiler,The operating system,The hardware,The network protocol,C,The text notes: 'OS may support record types or leave to application.'
"What is a significant problem encountered with a single-level directory system, especially in a multiuser environment?",Difficulty in assigning read-only permissions,Limited storage capacity for files,Naming problems requiring unique names for all files,Inability to support executable files,High latency for file access,C,The text explicitly mentions: 'Single-level directory: naming problems in multiuser systems (unique names required).'
How does a two-level directory system address the naming problems found in single-level directories?,By allowing shorter file names,By assigning each file a unique hexadecimal ID,By creating a separate directory for each user,By using a distributed hash table for file lookup,By encrypting file names,C,"The text states: 'Two-level directory: separate directory for each user, solves naming problems.'"
What information is typically listed for files within a two-level directory system?,Only the file's content and creation date,"File name, location, length, type, owner, and times","Network path, MAC address, and checksum",Processor architecture and memory usage,User's IP address and operating system version,B,"The text specifies: 'Lists file name, location, length, type, owner, times.'"
What is the primary characteristic of a tree-structured directory system?,"All files are stored in a single, flat directory.","It is a generalization of the two-level directory, allowing subdirectories.",It exclusively uses hard links for file sharing.,It requires manual deletion of unused file entries.,It only supports read-only files.,B,"The text describes it as: 'Tree-structured directory: generalization of two-level, allows subdirectories for organization.'"
Which type of directory structure allows for the sharing of subdirectories and files but complicates searching and deletion?,Single-level directory,Two-level directory,Tree-structured directory,Acyclic-graph directory,General graph structure,D,"The text states: 'Acyclic-graph directory: allows sharing of subdirectories/files, but complicates searching/deletion.'"
What is a potential complication when using an acyclic-graph directory structure?,Increased simplicity in file deletion.,Guaranteed unique file names across the system.,Complication in searching and deletion processes.,Restriction to a single owner per file.,Inability to link files across different volumes.,C,"The text states: 'Acyclic-graph directory: allows sharing of subdirectories/files, but complicates searching/deletion.'"
Which directory structure offers complete flexibility in sharing but may necessitate garbage collection for unused space?,Single-level directory,Two-level directory,Tree-structured directory,Acyclic-graph directory,General graph structure,E,"The text describes: 'General graph structure: complete flexibility in sharing, but may require garbage collection for unused space.'"
What are the key challenges associated with remote file systems as mentioned in the text?,Only storage capacity and file size limits.,Primarily user interface design and software licensing.,"Reliability, performance, and security.",Operating system compatibility and hardware upgrades.,Text encoding and character set support.,C,"The text lists: 'Remote file systems: challenges in reliability, performance, security.'"
In which type of system is file protection identified as particularly necessary?,Single-user systems,Batch processing systems,Multiuser systems,Embedded systems,Standalone systems,C,The text states: 'File protection: needed on multiuser systems.'
Which of the following are listed as types of access control for file protection?,"Compile, link, debug","Setup, install, uninstall","Read, write, execute, append, delete, list directory","Download, upload, stream","Zip, unzip, compress",C,"The text specifies: 'Access controlled by type: read, write, execute, append, delete, list directory.'"
What methods are mentioned for achieving file protection?,Only biometric authentication,Through encryption keys exclusively,"Via access lists, passwords, and other techniques",By limiting physical access to storage devices,Using only network firewalls,C,"The text states: 'Protection via access lists, passwords, other techniques.'"
