What is the fundamental role of an Operating System (OS)?,To provide the environment for program execution.,y
What critical step must precede the design of an Operating System?,Defining system goals.,y
What are the three primary perspectives from which an Operating System (OS) can be viewed?,"Its services, user/programmer interface, or internal components.",y
"Beyond providing an execution environment, how do OS services benefit programmers?",They simplify programming tasks.,y
What is the purpose of the User Interface (UI) service in an OS?,"Provides interaction via GUI, touch-screen, or CLI.",y
"Describe the ""Program execution"" service provided by an OS.","Loads, runs, and terminates programs.",y
"What is the role of the ""I/O operations"" service in an OS?",Manages program access to files and I/O devices for efficiency and protection.,y
"What capabilities does the ""File-system manipulation"" service provide?","Handles file/directory operations (read, write, create, delete, search, list) and permissions.",y
"What is the purpose of the ""Communications"" service in an OS?","Enables inter-process communication (IPC) via shared memory or message passing, locally or across networks.",y
"What does the ""Error detection"" service in an OS involve?","Constantly detects and corrects errors in hardware, I/O devices, and user programs, taking appropriate action (e.g., halting, terminating process, returning error code).",y
"How does the ""Resource allocation"" service contribute to efficient OS operation?","Manages allocation of CPU cycles, memory, file storage, and I/O devices to multiple running processes, using scheduling routines.",y
"What is the function of the ""Logging"" service in an OS?",Tracks resource usage for accounting or accumulating statistics to improve computing services.,y
"Explain the ""Protection and security"" service in an OS.","Controls access to system resources and defends against external/internal attacks (e.g., viruses, DoS). Requires user authentication and safeguards for I/O devices.",y
"Define ""user interface (UI)"".",A method by which a user interacts with a computer.,y
"Define ""graphical user interface (GUI)"".","A computer interface comprising a window system with a pointing device to direct I/O, choose from menus, and make selections and, usually, a keyboard to enter text.",y
"Define ""touch-screen interface"".",A user interface in which touching a screen allows the user to interact with the computer.,y
"Define ""command-line interface (CLI)"".",A method of giving commands to a computer based on a text input device (such as a keyboard).,y
"Define ""shared memory"" in the context of interprocess communication.","In interprocess communication, a section of memory shared by multiple processes and used for message passing.",y
"Define ""message passing"" in the context of interprocess communication.","In interprocess communication, a method of sharing data in which messages are sent and received by processes. Packets of information in predefined formats are moved between processes or between computers.",y
