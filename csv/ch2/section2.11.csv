Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
What is the primary role of an operating system concerning program execution?,To directly compile source code into executable files.,To debug programs and fix errors.,To provide an environment for the execution of programs.,To translate high-level programming languages into machine code.,To design and develop new software applications.,C,An operating system's fundamental role is to provide an environment where programs can be executed and to offer services to both users and programs.
Which of the following is NOT listed as a primary approach for interacting with an operating system?,Command interpreters,Graphical user interfaces (GUIs),Touch-screen interfaces,Direct hardware manipulation,All of the above are listed approaches.,D,"The text lists command interpreters, graphical user interfaces, and touch-screen interfaces as the three primary interaction approaches. Direct hardware manipulation is not mentioned as a primary interaction approach for users."
What do system calls provide to programmers for accessing operating system services?,A direct memory address to the kernel,A compiler for high-level languages,An application programming interface (API),A debugging tool,A network protocol for communication,C,Programmers use a system call's application programming interface (API) to access the services made available by an operating system.
Which of the following is one of the six major categories into which system calls can be divided?,Data encryption,Network routing,Process control,Database management,User authentication,C,"The text lists process control, file management, device management, information maintenance, communications, and protection as the six major categories of system calls."
"In UNIX and Linux systems, which library typically provides the system-call interface?",The standard Java library,The Python standard library,The standard C library,The Windows API library,The network library (NetLib),C,The standard C library provides the system-call interface for UNIX and Linux systems.
What is the function of a linker in the process of program execution?,It converts source code into object modules.,It loads an executable file into memory.,It combines several relocatable object modules into a single binary executable file.,It executes the program on an available CPU.,It monitors system performance using counters.,C,A linker's role is to combine several relocatable object modules into a single binary executable file.
"After a linker creates an executable file, what component is responsible for loading it into memory for execution?",The compiler,The debugger,The loader,The boot loader,The application programming interface (API),C,"A loader loads the executable file into memory, where it becomes eligible to run on an available CPU."
Which of the following is a reason why applications are often operating-system specific?,Varying CPU clock speeds,Different binary formats for program executables,User preference for interface design,Different network protocols,Availability of open-source software,B,"The text states that different binary formats for program executables, different instruction sets for different CPUs, and system calls that vary from one operating system to another are reasons for OS-specific applications."
"In operating system design, what do the system's goals ultimately determine?",The specific hardware requirements,The programming languages used for development,The operating system's policies,The number of users it can support simultaneously,The market price of the software,C,"An operating system is designed with specific goals in mind, and these goals ultimately determine the operating system's policies."
What is a characteristic feature of a monolithic operating system?,It is divided into a number of discrete layers.,Most services run as user-level applications.,"All functionality is provided in a single, static binary file that runs in a single address space.",Services are provided through modules that can be loaded and removed during run time.,It primarily uses message passing for communication between services.,C,"A monolithic operating system has no structure; all functionality is provided in a single, static binary file that runs in a single address space."
"What is the primary benefit of a monolithic operating system, despite its difficulty to modify?",Enhanced security features,Ease of development,Higher efficiency,Improved portability,Greater flexibility in design,C,"Although monolithic systems are difficult to modify, their primary benefit is efficiency."
Why is the layered approach generally not ideal for designing operating systems?,Due to excessive complexity in design.,Because of limitations in hardware capabilities.,Due to performance problems.,It requires specialized programming languages.,It lacks proper user interface support.,C,"Although layered software systems have had some success, this approach is generally not ideal for designing operating systems due to performance problems."
"In a microkernel approach to operating system design, where do most services typically run?",Directly on the hardware as firmware.,Within the kernel's address space.,As user-level applications.,On a dedicated coprocessor.,As part of the boot loader.,C,The microkernel approach uses a minimal kernel; most services run as user-level applications.
How does communication primarily take place between services in a microkernel operating system?,Through shared memory regions.,Via direct function calls to the kernel.,Through message passing.,By manipulating global variables.,Using hardware interrupts.,C,"In a microkernel system, communication takes place via message passing."
What characteristic defines a modular approach to operating system design?,All functionality is compiled into a single static binary.,Services are provided through modules that can be loaded and removed during run time.,It divides the OS into strictly defined layers.,It relies solely on user-level applications for all services.,It uses a client-server architecture exclusively.,B,A modular approach provides operating-system services through modules that can be loaded and removed during run time.
What term describes contemporary operating systems that combine a monolithic kernel with loadable modules?,Pure microkernels,Strict layered systems,Embedded systems,Hybrid systems,Distributed systems,D,Many contemporary operating systems are constructed as hybrid systems using a combination of a monolithic kernel and modules.
What is the function of a boot loader?,To compile source code into an executable file.,To manage inter-process communication.,"To load an operating system into memory, perform initialization, and begin system execution.",To provide a graphical user interface for interaction.,To perform routine system backups.,C,"A boot loader loads an operating system into memory, performs initialization, and begins system execution."
Which of the following methods is used for monitoring the performance of an operating system?,Binary recompilation,Runtime code analysis for errors,Counters,Hardware diagnostics on boot-up only,Virtualization of the entire system,C,The performance of an operating system can be monitored using either counters or tracing.
What is 'tracing' in the context of operating system performance monitoring?,Collecting system-wide or per-process statistics.,Following the execution of a program through the operating system.,Generating graphical representations of system load.,Identifying malicious software activity.,Optimizing memory allocation in real-time.,B,"Tracing follows the execution of a program through the operating system, whereas counters are a collection of system-wide or per-process statistics."
