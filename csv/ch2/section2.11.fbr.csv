What is the primary purpose of an operating system?,To provide an environment for the execution of programs by offering services to users and programs.,y
What are the three primary approaches for interacting with an operating system?,"1. Command interpreters
2. Graphical user interfaces (GUIs)
3. Touch-screen interfaces",y
What do system calls provide?,An interface to the services made available by an operating system.,y
How do programmers access system-call services?,They use a system call's application programming interface (API).,y
Name the six major categories of system calls.,"1. Process control
2. File management
3. Device management
4. Information maintenance
5. Communications
6. Protection",y
What provides the system-call interface for UNIX and Linux systems?,The standard C library.,y
What are system programs?,A collection of utilities provided by the operating system to users.,y
"Define ""linker"".",A program that combines several relocatable object modules into a single binary executable file.,y
"Define ""loader"".","A program that loads an executable file into memory, making it eligible to run on an available CPU.",y
Why are applications often operating-system specific?,"Due to different binary formats for program executables, different instruction sets for different CPUs, and system calls that vary between operating systems.",y
"How do goals, policies, and mechanisms relate in operating system design?","Specific design goals determine the operating system's policies, which are then implemented through specific mechanisms.",y
"Define ""monolithic operating system"".","An operating system with no structure, where all functionality is provided in a single, static binary file that runs in a single address space.",y
What is the primary benefit and drawback of a monolithic operating system?,"Benefit: Efficiency.
Drawback: Difficult to modify.",y
"Define ""layered operating system"".","An operating system divided into discrete layers, with the bottom layer as the hardware interface and the highest as the user interface.",y
Why is the layered approach generally not ideal for designing operating systems?,Due to performance problems.,y
"Describe the ""microkernel"" approach for OS design.","It uses a minimal kernel, with most services running as user-level applications.",y
How does communication occur in a microkernel operating system?,Via message passing.,y
"Describe the ""modular"" approach for OS design.",It provides operating-system services through modules that can be loaded and removed during run time.,y
"Define ""hybrid system"" in the context of operating systems.",A contemporary operating system constructed using a combination of a monolithic kernel and modules.,y
"Define ""boot loader"".","A program that loads an operating system into memory, performs initialization, and begins system execution.",y
What are two methods for monitoring the performance of an operating system?,Counters and tracing.,y
"Define ""counters"" in the context of OS performance monitoring.",A collection of system-wide or per-process statistics.,y
"Define ""tracing"" in the context of OS performance monitoring.",Following the execution of a program through the operating system.,y
