What are the three fundamental approaches users interface with the OS?,"Command-line interface (CLI) or command interpreter, and two forms of graphical user interface (GUI).",y
"How do most operating systems (e.g., Linux, UNIX, Windows) treat the command interpreter?",As a special program run at process initiation or user login.,y
What are systems with multiple command interpreters known as?,Shells.,y
Provide examples of shells on UNIX/Linux systems.,"C shell, Bourne-Again shell, Korn shell.",y
What is true about the functionality of different shells?,They provide similar functionality; choice is personal preference.,y
What is the main function of a command interpreter (or shell)?,"To get and execute user commands, often manipulating files (e.g., create, delete, list, print, copy, execute).",y
What are two ways commands can be implemented within a command interpreter?,"The interpreter contains the execution code, or commands are separate system programs.",y
What is a characteristic of commands implemented where the interpreter contains the code?,"The interpreter holds the execution code, which increases its size.",y
How are most commands implemented (regarding command interpreters)?,As separate system programs.,y
Provide an example of a command implemented as a separate system program in UNIX.,`rm file.txt` executes the `rm` program.,y
What is an advantage of implementing commands as separate system programs?,It allows easy addition of new commands without changing the interpreter.,y
What does GUI stand for?,Graphical User Interface.,y
How do users interact with a GUI?,With a mouse-based window-and-menu system using a desktop metaphor.,y
What do icons represent in a GUI?,"Programs, files, and functions.",y
How are actions invoked using icons or menus in a GUI?,By clicking icons or selecting from menus.,y
Where did GUIs originate?,"Xerox PARC (1973, Xerox Alto).",y
Which company helped make GUIs widespread in the 1980s?,Apple Macintosh.,y
What GUI interface did macOS adopt?,Aqua interface.,y
How did Microsoft Windows first incorporate a GUI?,Version 1.0 added a GUI to MS-DOS.,y
Name two GUIs available for traditionally CLI-dominated UNIX systems.,KDE and GNOME.,y
Under what type of licenses are KDE and GNOME available?,Open-source licenses.,y
What type of interface do smartphones and tablets typically use?,A touch-screen interface.,y
Why are CLI/mouse systems impractical for smartphones and tablets?,Because they are designed for touch-screen interaction.,y
How do users interact with a touch-screen interface?,"Via gestures (e.g., pressing, swiping).",y
How do most mobile devices handle keyboard input?,They simulate keyboards on the touch screen.,y
What touch-screen interface do Apple iPhone/iPad use?,Springboard.,y
What often determines the choice between CLI and GUI?,Personal preference.,y
Who typically prefers the CLI?,System administrators and power users.,y
Why do system administrators and power users prefer the CLI?,"For efficiency and faster access, especially for repetitive tasks via shell scripts.",y
How do some systems handle functionality distribution between GUI and CLI?,"They offer only a subset of functions via GUI, reserving less common tasks for CLI.",y
What interface do most Windows users prefer?,The GUI.,y
What interfaces do recent Windows versions offer?,Both standard GUI and touch-screen interfaces.,y
What interfaces does macOS provide?,Both the Aqua GUI and a command-line interface.,y
What is the kernel of macOS based on?,UNIX.,y
"What type of interface do mobile systems (e.g., iOS, Android) predominantly use?",Touch-screen interfaces.,y
Is the user interface typically part of the core OS structure?,"No, it is typically separate.",y
