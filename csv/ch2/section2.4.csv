"Under which system service category would querying the system for date, time, memory/disk usage, or user count fall?",File modification,Communications,Background services,Status information,Programming-language support,D,"Status information includes 'Query system for date, time, memory/disk, user count; performance, logging, debugging.'"
"In the context of system services, what is the primary role of the 'Registry'?",To provide text editing capabilities for file modification.,To store and retrieve configuration information.,To manage network connections and communications.,To handle program loading and execution processes.,To provide support for programming languages like compilers.,B,"The text states that the 'Registry' is used 'for configuration' under Status Information, and the glossary defines it as 'A file, set of files, or service used to store and retrieve configuration information.'"
"Compilers, assemblers, debuggers, and interpreters for languages like C, C++, Java, and Python are typically provided under which category of system services?",File modification,Programming-language support,Program loading and execution,Status information,Background services,B,"Programming-language support includes 'Compilers, assemblers, debuggers, interpreters (C, C++, Java, Python) often OS-provided.'"
"Which system service category includes various types of loaders, such as absolute, relocatable, linkage editors, and overlay loaders?",File management,Communications,Programming-language support,Program loading and execution,File modification,D,"Program loading and execution includes 'Loaders (absolute, relocatable, linkage editors, overlay)'."
"Sending messages, web browsing, e-mail, remote login, and file transfer are examples of functionalities associated with which system service category?",Status information,Communications,Background services,File modification,Programming-language support,B,"Communications are described as enabling 'Virtual connections among processes, users, systems. Messages, web browsing, e-mail, remote login, file transfer.'"
"System programs launched at boot that run constantly, such as network services, schedulers, error monitoring, and print servers, are collectively known as what?",Application programs,Communications utilities,Background services,File modification tools,Programming-language support,C,"Background services are defined as 'System programs launched at boot. Constantly running: services, subsystems, daemons (e.g., network, schedulers, error monitoring, print servers).'"
"According to the glossary, what is a 'system service' or 'system utility'?","A program designed for end-user execution, such as a word processor.",A subset of an operating system responsible for a specific function.,"A file, set of files, or service used to store and retrieve configuration information.",A collection of applications included with or added to an operating system to provide services beyond those provided by the kernel.,A software entity running on one or more machines and providing a particular type of function to calling clients.,D,The glossary defines both 'system service' and 'system utility' as 'A collection of applications included with or added to an operating system to provide services beyond those provided by the kernel.'
"The definition of 'registry' in the glossary specifies it as a file, set of files, or service used to store and retrieve configuration information. What additional detail is provided regarding its function in Windows?",It manages system calls.,It is responsible for direct hardware interaction.,It is the manager of hives of data.,It provides user interface elements.,It handles network communications.,C,"The glossary states: 'In Windows, the manager of hives of data.'"
"Beyond being a software entity providing a function to calling clients, how is 'service' specifically described in the context of Android?",An application component that directly interacts with the user interface.,An application component with no user interface; it runs in the background while executing long-running operations or performing work for remote processes.,A type of loader for program execution.,A tool for debugging high-level languages.,A specific category of file management operations.,B,"The glossary states: 'In Android, an application component with no user interface; it runs in the background while executing long-running operations or performing work for remote processes.'"
What is the definition of a 'subsystem' as provided in the section glossary?,A program designed for end-user execution.,A collection of applications providing services beyond the kernel.,A subset of an operating system responsible for a specific function.,A file used to store configuration information.,A software entity providing a function to calling clients.,C,"The glossary defines 'subsystem' as 'A subset of an operating system responsible for a specific function (e.g., memory management).'"
"How do 'Application programs' primarily shape a user's operating system view, according to the text?",By defining the system calls available to users.,By providing the core kernel functionalities.,"By enabling diverse interfaces (GUI, CLI) or dual-booting.",By directly managing hardware resources.,By performing debugging for machine languages.,C,"The text states: 'User's OS view shaped by these programs, not system calls; enables diverse interfaces (GUI, CLI) or dual-booting.'"
Which of the following best describes an 'application program'?,"A program designed for end-user execution, such as a word processor or web browser.",A core component of the operating system kernel.,A background service launched at boot that runs constantly.,A utility for storing and retrieving configuration information.,"A tool primarily used for programming-language support, like a compiler.",A,"The text defines 'Application programs (e.g., web browsers, word processors)' and the glossary defines 'application program' as 'A Program designed for end-user execution, such as a word processor, spreadsheet, compiler, or Web browser.'"
