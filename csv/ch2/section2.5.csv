The glossary further clarifies its role in making the program eligible to run on a CPU core."
"According to the provided text, what characteristic defines a 'relocatable object file'?",It is a file that contains only source code comments.,It is the output of a compiler whose contents can be loaded into any location in physical memory.,It is a final executable program ready for direct execution without further processing.,It is a temporary file used only during the debugging phase.,It is a type of standard library that is always linked dynamically.,B,The glossary defines 'relocatable object file' as: 'The output of a compiler in which the contents can be loaded into any location in physical memory.'
Which of the following best describes an 'executable file' as defined in the text?,A file that must undergo further compilation before it can run.,A file containing only uncompiled source code.,A file containing a program that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed.,A file primarily used for storing configuration settings.,A file that only contains data without any program instructions.,C,The glossary defines 'executable file' as: 'A file containing a program that is ready to be loaded into memory and executed.'
What is 'relocation' in the context of program loading and execution?,The process of moving a program from memory back to disk.,An activity during linking and loading that assigns final addresses to program parts and adjusts code/data.,The conversion of high-level source code into machine code.,The mechanism for isolating processes from each other in memory.,The method used to verify the integrity of an executable file.,B,The text states: 'Relocation: A crucial activity during linking and loading that assigns final addresses to program parts and adjusts code/data to match.' This is consistent with the glossary definition.
When does the crucial activity of 'relocation' primarily occur in the program's lifecycle?,Exclusively during the initial compilation phase.,Only when the program terminates or crashes.,During both the linking and loading phases.,Only during the initial source code writing phase.,After the program has been fully loaded but before execution begins.,C,The text specifies: 'Relocation: A crucial activity during linking and loading...'
What is the main characteristic of 'dynamically linked libraries (DLLs)'?,They are always embedded directly into the executable file at compile time.,"They are system libraries that are linked to user programs at runtime, with linking postponed until execution time.",They contain only data and cannot include any executable code.,They are exclusively used by operating system kernel modules.,They must be manually compiled and linked by the user for every program.,B,"The glossary defines 'dynamically linked libraries (DLLs)' as: 'System libraries that are linked to user programs when the processes are run, with linking postponed until execution time.'"
Which of the following is a key advantage of using dynamically linked libraries (DLLs)?,"They force all programs to load all available libraries, regardless of need.","They eliminate the need for a compiler, speeding up development.",They prevent programs from accessing system resources.,"They avoid loading unused libraries and allow multiple processes to share common libraries, saving memory.",They ensure that programs are completely isolated from each other's memory spaces.,D,"The text highlights the benefits: 'This avoids loading unused libraries and allows multiple processes to share common libraries, saving memory.'"
"On UNIX systems, what is the typical sequence of system calls the shell uses to create a new process and invoke the loader for a program (e.g., ./main)?",compile() then run(),exec() then fork(),load() then execute(),fork() then exec(),create_process() then start(),D,"The text states: 'On UNIX systems, invoking a program (e.g., ./main) triggers the shell to create a new process via fork() and then use exec() to invoke the loader.'"
What is the standard format for object and executable files used on UNIX/Linux systems?,Portable Executable (PE),Mach-O,Executable and Linkable Format (ELF),Common Object File Format (COFF),Windows Executable (WINEX),C,The text explicitly states: 'ELF (Executable and Linkable Format): The standard for UNIX/Linux systems...'
Which components are typically included within an ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) file?,Only the source code and design documentation.,Compiled machine code and a symbol table.,Only configuration files and user preferences.,Debugging symbols and runtime logs.,Graphical user interface assets and themes.,B,The text mentions that ELF 'includes compiled machine code and a symbol table. It contains the program's entry point.'
Which file format is specifically used by Windows systems for executable files?,ELF,Mach-O,Portable Executable (PE),APK,JAR,C,The text specifies: 'Portable Executable (PE): Used by Windows systems.' This is also in the glossary.
What is the name of the executable file format used by macOS?,ELF,PE,Mach-O,Dylib,Executable Link Format (XLF),C,The text states: 'Mach-O: Used by macOS.' This is also in the glossary.
"On Linux, which command is specifically mentioned for identifying the type of an ELF file, such as distinguishing between an ELF relocatable file and an ELF executable?",readelf,ls,file,objdump,nm,C,"The text explains: 'For example, the file command determines a file type. If main.o is an object file... will report that main.o is an ELF relocatable file, while the command file main will report that main is an ELF executable.'"
Which command is used on Linux systems to evaluate the various sections within an ELF file?,file,cat,readelf,grep,head,C,The text explicitly states: 'ELF files are divided into a number of sections and can be evaluated using the readelf command.'
"What is the ultimate purpose of the loader, once it loads a binary executable file into memory?",To save the program's state to disk.,To delete the original executable file from disk.,To make the program eligible to run on a CPU core.,To compress the program to save memory space.,To convert the binary file back into source code.,C,"The glossary definition of 'loader' specifies: 'A system service that loads a binary executable file into memory, where it is eligible to run on a CPU core.'"
Which activity is crucial during both linking and loading processes for assigning final addresses and adjusting code/data in a program?,Compiling,Debugging,Optimization,Relocation,Versioning,D,The text defines 'Relocation' as 'A crucial activity during linking and loading that assigns final addresses to program parts and adjusts code/data to match.'
"A program containing compiled machine code and a symbol table, serving as the UNIX standard for relocatable and executable files, is defined as what?",Portable Executable (PE),Mach-O,Dynamically Linked Library (DLL),Executable and Linkable Format (ELF),Relocatable Object Code (ROC),D,The text and glossary define 'ELF (Executable and Linkable Format)' as the 'UNIX standard format for relocatable and executable files' that includes 'compiled machine code and a symbol table.'
