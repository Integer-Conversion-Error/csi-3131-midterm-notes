Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
What is the primary reason applications compiled on one operating system are generally not executable on others?,Lack of sufficient memory on the target system.,Incompatible user interfaces.,Unique system calls and other architectural barriers.,Different programming languages used for development.,Proprietary software licenses.,C,The text states that applications are generally not executable on other OSes due to 'unique system calls and other barriers'.
Which of the following is NOT one of the three main ways an application can be made available to run on multiple operating systems?,Using interpreted languages.,Embedding the entire operating system within the application.,Utilizing virtual machines.,Employing standard languages/APIs with subsequent porting.,None of the above; all are listed methods.,B,"The text lists interpreted languages, virtual machines, and standard language/API with porting as the three ways. Embedding the entire OS is not mentioned."
Applications written in interpreted languages like Python or Ruby achieve cross-platform compatibility by:,Compiling directly into machine-specific binaries for each OS.,Relying on a virtual machine to emulate the target OS.,Using an interpreter available for multiple operating systems that executes equivalent native instructions.,Requiring manual recoding of the application for each new platform.,Automatically converting their code into C++ before execution.,C,The text explains that interpreted languages 'use an interpreter available for multiple operating systems. The interpreter executes equivalent native instructions and calls native OS functions.'
What are common disadvantages associated with using interpreted languages and virtual machines for cross-platform application compatibility?,Increased security vulnerabilities and higher development costs.,Reduced performance and potential limitations on features.,Strict dependency on specific hardware architectures.,Inability to interact with native operating system functions.,Requirement for a separate license for each operating system.,B,"For both interpreted languages and virtual machines, the text notes that 'Performance may suffer, and features might be limited' or 'This approach has similar disadvantages to interpreters.'"
The 'standard language/API with porting' approach for cross-platform compatibility involves:,Creating a single binary that runs universally on all operating systems.,"Using a language where the compiler generates machine- and OS-specific binaries, requiring the application to be ported to each OS.",Translating the application code into a different language for each target platform.,Leveraging a cloud-based service to stream the application to users.,Designing the application to run exclusively in a web browser.,B,The text describes this method as when 'Application developers use a standard language or API where the compiler generates machine- and OS-specific binaries. The application must be ported to each OS.'
Which API is provided as an example for UNIX-like systems when discussing the 'standard language/API with porting' approach?,DirectX API,Cocoa API,POSIX API,Win32 API,Android SDK,C,"The text states, 'POSIX API is an example for UNIX-like systems' under the 'Standard language/API with porting' section."
Which of the following is an architectural difference that makes cross-platform application development challenging?,Varying screen resolutions across devices.,Differences in network protocols used by operating systems.,Unique binary formats for applications across different OSes.,The number of concurrent users supported by the OS.,"The preferred file system type (e.g., NTFS vs. EXT4).",C,The text lists 'Binary formats: Each OS has a unique binary format' as a key architectural difference.
What role do CPU instruction sets play in the challenge of cross-platform application development?,They determine the maximum RAM an application can use.,"They vary across different CPUs, requiring applications to contain appropriate instructions for correct execution.",They dictate the graphical user interface of an application.,They define the network communication protocols.,They are standardized globally and pose no challenge.,B,"The text states, 'CPU instruction sets: CPUs have varying instruction sets, requiring applications to contain appropriate instructions for correct execution.'"
Operating system system calls vary significantly in which aspects?,Only their names and version numbers.,Only their security levels and encryption methods.,"Operands, ordering, invocation methods, numbering, meanings, and result returns.",Their underlying programming language and compilation tools.,The amount of CPU time they are allowed to consume.,C,"The text specifies that 'OS system calls vary significantly in operands, ordering, invocation methods, numbering, meanings, and result returns.'"
"What is the ELF format primarily used for, as adopted by Linux?",Defining network communication protocols.,A common standard for binary executable files across Linux and UNIX systems.,Specifying user interface guidelines.,Managing file system permissions.,Encrypting application data.,B,The text mentions 'Linux's adoption of the ELF format for binary executable files provide a common standard across Linux and UNIX systems'.
"While the ELF format provides a common standard for binary executables across Linux and UNIX systems, what does it NOT guarantee?",Compatibility with different file system types.,Cross-hardware platform compatibility.,Interoperability with Windows applications.,Support for interpreted languages.,Enhanced graphics rendering.,B,The text explicitly states that ELF 'do not guarantee cross-hardware platform compatibility'.
What does an Application Binary Interface (ABI) define?,How applications manage graphical user interfaces across different OSes.,The standards for network communication between applications.,How different components of binary code interface for a given operating system on a specific architecture.,The licensing agreements for commercial software.,The programming language syntax for system-level development.,C,The glossary defines ABI as 'Defines how different components of binary code can interface for a given operating system on a given architecture.' The main text also reiterates this definition.
Which of the following is NOT typically specified by an Application Binary Interface (ABI)?,Address width.,Parameter passing methods for system calls.,The color scheme of the operating system's desktop environment.,Runtime stack organization.,Data type sizes.,C,"The text lists address width, parameter passing methods for system calls, runtime stack organization, binary format of system libraries, and data type sizes as low-level details specified by ABIs. Desktop color scheme is not mentioned."
What is the key limitation of an Application Binary Interface (ABI) regarding cross-platform compatibility?,It only supports open-source software.,"It is defined for a specific OS and architecture, thus not providing cross-platform compatibility.",It is only compatible with virtualized environments.,It only ensures compatibility for applications written in assembly language.,It increases the overall size of binary executables.,B,"The text clearly states, 'While an ABI ensures compatibility on systems supporting that ABI, it does not provide cross-platform compatibility as it is defined for a specific OS and architecture.'"
What does the term 'port' mean in the context of software development?,To secure a network connection.,To debug a software application.,"To move code from its current platform to another platform (e.g., between operating systems or hardware systems).",To compress a large software file.,To install a new operating system.,C,"The glossary defines 'port' as 'To move code from its current platform to another platform (e.g., between operating systems or hardware systems).'"
"Based on the text, why does a program like Firefox require extensive work to run across various platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and CPU architectures?",Due to its complex graphical user interface design.,"Because of fundamental differences in operating systems and CPU types, necessitating specific compilation unless an interpreter or RTE is used.",To comply with different international software regulations.,Mainly to support various web browser extensions.,To ensure maximum compatibility with outdated hardware.,B,"The summary states, 'these differences necessitate that applications are written for and compiled on a specific operating system and CPU type (e.g., Intel x86 or ARM v8) unless an interpreter or RTE is used. This explains the extensive work required for programs like Firefox to run across various platforms.'"
