Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
Which of the following best defines 'debugging' in the context of operating system development?,The process of installing new software updates.,The process of finding and fixing errors or 'bugs' in a system.,The activity of analyzing program performance to identify bottlenecks.,The creation of new system features and functionalities.,The process of backing up system data to prevent loss.,B,"Debugging is explicitly defined as 'the process of finding and fixing errors, or bugs' in the text."
"In operating system development, what is considered a 'bug'?",A physical defect in hardware components.,A type of network anomaly.,An error in a program.,A security vulnerability discovered in an application.,A user-reported issue with system usability.,C,The text's glossary defines 'bug' as 'An error in a program.'
What is a primary reason debugging operating systems is challenging?,The limited availability of debugging tools.,The difficulty of reproducing errors and the system's concurrent nature.,The high cost of debugging software licenses.,The lack of experienced debugging professionals.,The inability to access system logs.,B,The text states that debugging 'can be challenging due to the difficulty of reproducing errors and the system's concurrent nature.'
What is the purpose of 'log files' as a debugging tool?,To store backup copies of the operating system.,To record the sequence of events or function calls during program execution.,To provide a snapshot of a process's memory at the time of a crash.,To analyze program performance and identify bottlenecks.,"To record system-generated events, errors, and warnings for analysis.",E,"Log files are described as 'System-generated files that record events, errors, and warnings. Analyzing these logs helps identify the cause of issues.'"
A 'core dump' is most accurately described as:,A file containing the current state of all active processes on a system.,"A snapshot of the memory of a specific process at the time of a crash, useful for post-mortem analysis.",A complete backup of the operating system's kernel and drivers.,A detailed record of network traffic and communication errors.,A list of all hardware components and their current status.,B,"A core dump is defined as 'A snapshot of the memory of a process at the time of a crash. It contains the state of the program, including register values, stack, and memory, useful for post-mortem analysis.' The glossary also states: 'A file containing the state of a program when it crashed.'"
How does a 'crash dump' (or 'system dump') differ from a 'core dump'?,"A crash dump captures the state of a specific application, while a core dump captures system performance metrics.","A crash dump is exclusively used for hardware failures, whereas a core dump is for software bugs.","A crash dump is a snapshot of the entire operating system's state when it crashes, while a core dump is for a single process.","A crash dump is a real-time monitoring tool, and a core dump is a post-mortem analysis tool.",There is no difference; the terms are interchangeable.,C,"The text states a crash dump is 'Similar to a core dump but for the entire operating system. It captures the system's state when a kernel panic or system crash occurs.' Conversely, a core dump is for a process."
"Which debugging tool allows developers to step through code, inspect variables, and set breakpoints to understand program execution flow?",Log files,Core dump,Debugger,System monitor,Benchmarking tool,C,"A debugger is described as 'A software tool that allows developers to step through code, inspect variables, and set breakpoints to understand program execution flow and identify bugs.'"
What is the primary objective of 'tracing' as a debugging technique?,To identify which parts of a program consume the most resources.,To record the sequence of events or function calls during program execution for insight into behavior.,To measure system performance under specific workloads.,To create a memory snapshot of a crashed process.,To track real-time system resource usage.,B,"Tracing is defined as 'A technique to record the sequence of events or function calls during program execution, providing insights into behavior.'"
What is 'profiling' primarily used for in the context of debugging and system analysis?,To detect and correct hardware errors.,To manage and allocate system memory.,To analyze program performance to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.,To secure the operating system against external threats.,To create detailed documentation of system architecture.,C,Profiling is defined as 'Analyzing program performance to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.'
'Performance tuning' is an activity focused on which of the following?,Enhancing system security protocols.,Improving system efficiency.,Detecting and fixing software bugs.,Developing new application features.,Creating user interface designs.,B,Performance tuning is described as 'a related activity focused on improving system efficiency.' The glossary also defines it as 'An activity that improves the performance of a system.'
"Which type of tool is used in performance tuning to identify which parts of a program consume the most resources (CPU, memory)?",Log files,System monitors,Benchmarking tools,Profilers,Debuggers,D,"Profilers are listed as tools for performance tuning that 'Identify which parts of a program consume the most resources (CPU, memory).'"
What is the primary function of 'system monitors' in the context of performance tuning?,To measure system performance under specific workloads.,To track real-time system resource usage like CPU utilization and memory usage.,To capture the state of the operating system when it crashes.,To record sequences of events for post-mortem analysis.,To allow developers to step through code and inspect variables.,B,"System monitors 'Track real-time system resource usage (CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network activity).'"
What is the main purpose of 'benchmarking tools'?,To find and fix errors in program code.,To identify memory leaks in an application.,To measure system performance under specific workloads for comparison.,To record system-generated warnings and errors.,To provide a step-by-step execution view of a program.,C,Benchmarking tools 'Measure system performance under specific workloads to compare against baselines or other systems.'
