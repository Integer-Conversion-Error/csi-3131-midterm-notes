What is debugging in operating system development?,A crucial task involving the detection and correction of errors.,y
What types of errors can debugging address in an operating system?,Errors ranging from hardware failures to application bugs.,y
Define debugging.,"The process of finding and fixing errors, or bugs.",y
Define bug.,An error in a program.,y
Why are operating systems prone to bugs?,They are large and complex.,y
What makes debugging challenging in operating systems?,Difficulty of reproducing errors and the system's concurrent nature.,y
What are log files used for in debugging?,"System-generated files that record events, errors, and warnings; analyzing them helps identify the cause of issues.",y
Define core dump.,"A file containing a snapshot of the memory and state of a process at the time of a crash, including register values, stack, and memory, useful for post-mortem analysis.",y
Define crash dump.,"A file containing the state of the entire operating system when a kernel panic or system crash occurs, similar to a core dump but at the system level.",y
Define system dump.,"A file containing the state of the entire operating system when a kernel panic or system crash occurs, similar to a core dump but at the system level.",y
What is a debugger?,"A software tool that allows developers to step through code, inspect variables, and set breakpoints to understand program execution flow and identify bugs.",y
Explain tracing as a debugging technique.,"A technique to record the sequence of events or function calls during program execution, providing insights into behavior.",y
What is profiling in the context of debugging?,Analyzing program performance to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.,y
Define performance tuning.,An activity focused on improving system efficiency.,y
What are profilers used for in performance tuning?,"Identifying which parts of a program consume the most resources (CPU, memory).",y
What are system monitors used for in performance tuning?,"Tracking real-time system resource usage (CPU utilization, memory usage, disk I/O, network activity).",y
What are benchmarking tools used for in performance tuning?,Measuring system performance under specific workloads to compare against baselines or other systems.,y
