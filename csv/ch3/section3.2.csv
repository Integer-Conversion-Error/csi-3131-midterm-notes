Which statement accurately describes a 'context switch'?,It is a process that is designed to perform heavy computations.,It is the act of moving a process between main memory and a backing store.,"It is the switching of the CPU from one process to another, requiring a state save of the old process and a state restore of the new process.",It is a mechanism for a process to request I/O services from the operating system.,It is a visual representation of process flow through various queues.,C,"The text states 'Context switch: Switching CPU core from one process to another (state save old, state restore new)' and the glossary provides a similar definition emphasizing 'state save' and 'state restore'."
Which of the following statements about context switches is true?,They are considered useful work because they advance a process's execution.,Their speed is primarily determined by the number of CPU cores available.,"They contribute to pure overhead, as no useful work is done during the switch.",Hardware support for multiple register sets typically slows down context switches.,More complex OS/memory management always leads to faster context switches.,C,The text clearly states that a context switch is 'Pure overhead (no useful work done during switch)'.
