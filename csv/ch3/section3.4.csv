Which characteristic accurately describes 'independent processes'?,They rely on shared memory for all operations.,They share data and frequently affect each other's execution.,They do not share data with other processes.,They strictly require an IPC mechanism to operate.,Their primary goal is computation speedup through parallelization.,C,Independent processes are characterized by having no shared data with other processes.
What defines 'cooperating processes'?,They always execute sequentially without overlap.,They never interact or exchange any information.,They share data and can affect each other's operations.,They are exclusively designed for single-core processor systems.,They are typically used to reduce system modularity.,C,Cooperating processes are defined by their ability to share data and influence each other's execution.
Why do cooperating processes require an IPC mechanism?,To enforce strict isolation between them.,To prevent any form of data sharing.,To exchange data and information.,To minimize their overall system resource usage.,To ensure they run on separate physical machines.,C,Cooperating processes need an Interprocess Communication (IPC) mechanism to facilitate the exchange of data between them.
Which of the following is a primary reason for process cooperation related to shared information?,Eliminating the need for any form of shared resources.,"Information sharing, allowing concurrent access to data.",Strictly enforcing sequential execution of tasks.,Reducing the total number of processes in a system.,Decreasing the overall system's security posture.,B,"Information sharing, which involves concurrent access to shared data (e.g., copy/paste), is a key reason for process cooperation."
How does 'computation speedup' serve as a reason for process cooperation?,By ensuring tasks run on a single CPU core only.,"By breaking a task into subtasks for parallel execution, often requiring multiple cores.",By prioritizing single-threaded applications over multi-threaded ones.,By minimizing the total number of operations performed by the system.,By preventing any process from affecting another's execution.,B,"Computation speedup is achieved when a task is divided into subtasks that can be executed in parallel, often requiring multiple cores, making cooperation essential."
"In the context of process cooperation, what is the benefit of 'modularity'?","It concentrates all system functions into a single, monolithic process.",It mandates that processes operate entirely in isolation.,It divides system functions into separate processes or threads.,It eliminates the need for any form of interprocess communication.,It simplifies system design by reducing the total number of components.,C,"Modularity contributes to process cooperation by allowing system functions to be divided into separate, manageable processes or threads."
What are the two fundamental Interprocess Communication (IPC) models mentioned?,Pipes and Sockets,Shared Memory and Message Passing,Files and Databases,Signals and Semaphores,Remote Procedure Calls and Local Procedure Calls,B,The text identifies Shared Memory and Message Passing as the two fundamental IPC models.
Which of the following best defines 'shared memory' in IPC?,A dedicated hardware component for direct CPU-to-CPU communication.,A temporary buffer used exclusively by the operating system kernel.,A section of memory shared by multiple processes for communication.,A network protocol for transferring large data blocks between remote servers.,A method where processes send discrete packets of information to each other.,C,Shared memory is defined as a section of memory shared by multiple processes for interprocess communication.
How do processes typically exchange information when utilizing the Shared Memory IPC model?,By making repeated system calls for each data transfer.,By sending predefined messages through a kernel intermediary.,By directly reading from and writing to the shared memory region.,By encrypting and decrypting data packets for secure exchange.,By using network interfaces for local communication.,C,"In the shared memory model, processes exchange information by directly reading from and writing to the designated shared region."
What is a key performance advantage of Shared Memory over Message Passing?,It is always slower for any data size.,It requires more kernel intervention for every access.,It is faster after setup because it requires no kernel intervention for access.,It is only faster in highly distributed systems.,Its speed is primarily limited by network bandwidth.,C,Shared Memory is faster than Message Passing after its initial setup because data access occurs directly without repeated kernel intervention.
Which statement accurately describes the role of kernel intervention in the Shared Memory IPC model for data access?,The kernel intervenes for every single read or write operation.,"Kernel intervention is typically needed only for initial setup, not for subsequent data access.",It always requires more kernel intervention than Message Passing.,Kernel intervention is completely absent in the Shared Memory model.,The kernel intervenes only when data conflicts occur.,B,"A significant feature of Shared Memory is that, after the initial setup, processes can access the shared region directly without continuous kernel intervention."
What is the primary method of communication in the Message Passing IPC model?,Direct manipulation of a common memory segment.,Exchanging information through messages sent and received between processes.,Utilizing a central database for data storage.,Sharing files via a network file system.,Establishing a direct hardware link between communicating processes.,B,Message passing involves communication via messages exchanged between processes.
For what type of data amounts is Message Passing considered most useful?,"Extremely large, continuous data streams.","Smaller data amounts, especially when avoiding conflicts.",Only encrypted data for secure transactions.,Data requiring very high throughput and low latency.,Unstructured data without specific formats.,B,Message passing is noted as useful for smaller data amounts and situations where avoiding conflicts is desirable.
In which type of system is the Message Passing IPC model generally easier to implement?,"Highly centralized, single-processor systems.",Systems with very limited memory resources.,Distributed systems.,Systems where all processes reside in the same address space.,Legacy systems with no network capabilities.,C,Message passing is explicitly stated to be easier to implement in distributed systems.
What is a characteristic of Message Passing regarding kernel intervention and speed compared to Shared Memory?,It is generally faster than shared memory due to less system call overhead.,"It typically uses system calls (kernel intervention), making it slower than shared memory.","It completely bypasses the kernel for all communication, leading to high speed.",Its speed is identical to shared memory in all scenarios.,Kernel intervention only occurs during system boot-up.,B,"Message passing typically uses system calls, involving kernel intervention, which generally makes it slower than shared memory."
"According to the provided text, what is the function of a 'browser' process?",To compile and execute programming code.,To manage all network connections and traffic.,To accept a URL and display its contents on a screen.,To handle the storage and retrieval of user data.,"To provide a secure, contained environment for other processes.",C,A browser is defined as a process that accepts input in the form of a URL and displays its contents on a screen.
What is the primary responsibility of a 'renderer' process?,To act as an add-on functionality to expand a process.,To contain logic for rendering contents onto a display.,To manage the secure environment of other processes.,To handle interprocess communication exclusively.,To translate URLs into network addresses.,B,A renderer is a process that contains logic for rendering contents (such as web pages) onto a display.
What is a 'plug-in' defined as?,A standalone operating system component.,A core security feature of a browser.,An add-on functionality that expands the primary functionality of a process.,A method for interprocess communication.,A type of shared memory segment.,C,"A plug-in is defined as an add-on functionality that expands the primary functionality of a process (e.g., a web browser plug-in)."
