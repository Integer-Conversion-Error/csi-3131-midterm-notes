What are independent processes?,Processes that have no shared data.,y
What are cooperating processes?,Processes that share data and affect each other.,y
List reasons for process cooperation.,"Information sharing, computation speedup, and modularity.",y
Explain 'Information sharing' as a reason for process cooperation.,"Concurrent access to shared information (e.g., copy/paste).",y
Explain 'Computation speedup' as a reason for process cooperation.,"Breaking a task into subtasks for parallel execution, which requires multiple cores.",y
Explain 'Modularity' as a reason for process cooperation.,Dividing system functions into separate processes/threads.,y
What mechanism do cooperating processes need to exchange data?,An IPC (Interprocess Communication) mechanism.,y
What are the two fundamental Interprocess Communication (IPC) models?,Shared Memory and Message Passing.,y
Describe the Shared Memory IPC model.,"A region of memory shared by cooperating processes, where information is exchanged by reading/writing to the shared region.",y
What are the advantages of Shared Memory IPC?,It is faster than message passing (after setup) and requires no kernel intervention for access.,y
Describe the Message Passing IPC model.,Communication via messages exchanged between processes.,y
When is Message Passing IPC useful?,"For smaller data amounts, when no conflicts are desired, and it is easier in distributed systems.",y
What is a disadvantage of Message Passing IPC?,"It typically uses system calls (kernel intervention), making it slower than shared memory.",y
Define Interprocess Communication (IPC).,Communication between processes.,y
Define Shared Memory (in the context of IPC).,"In interprocess communication, a section of memory shared by multiple processes and used for message passing.",y
Define Message Passing (in the context of IPC).,"In interprocess communication, a method of sharing data in which messages are sent and received by processes. Packets of information in predefined formats are moved between processes or between computers.",y
Define Browser (as a process).,"A process that accepts input in the form of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator), or web address, and displays its contents on a screen.",y
Define Renderer (as a process).,A process that contains logic for rendering contents (such as web pages) onto a display.,y
Define Plug-in.,"An add-on functionality that expands the primary functionality of a process (e.g., a web browser plug-in that displays a type of content different from what the browser can natively handle).",y
Define Sandbox.,"A contained environment (e.g., a virtual machine).",y
