Threads share the code section, data section, and OS resources with other threads of the same process."
"According to the text, which of the following is NOT shared among threads belonging to the same process?",Code section,Data section,"Operating system resources (e.g., open files)",The program counter (PC),Signals,D,"Threads share the code section, data section, and OS resources (like open files and signals) with other threads of the same process. The program counter (PC) is part of a thread's unique context, along with its thread ID, register set, and stack."
What is the primary characteristic that distinguishes a traditional process from a multithreaded process?,A traditional process can only run on a single-core system.,"A multithreaded process has a single thread of control, while a traditional process has multiple.","A traditional process has a single thread of control, allowing it to perform only one task at a time, whereas a multithreaded process can perform multiple tasks concurrently.","Multithreaded processes do not require OS support, unlike traditional processes.",Traditional processes are more efficient in resource sharing than multithreaded processes.,C,"The text states, 'A traditional process has a single thread of control; a multithreaded process can perform multiple tasks concurrently.'"
Why is identifying opportunities for parallelism using threads considered crucial for modern multicore systems?,It simplifies the operating system kernel's design.,It ensures that applications are always single-threaded.,It allows applications to effectively leverage the multiple processing cores available for concurrent execution.,It reduces the need for context switching.,It limits the number of tasks a process can perform.,C,"The text explicitly states that 'Identifying opportunities for parallelism using threads is crucial for modern multicore systems,' implying that this is how applications can utilize multiple cores."
Which statement best describes the current trend in modern software applications?,Most modern software applications are single-threaded to simplify development.,Modern applications primarily use process-creation methods for concurrent tasks.,"The majority of modern software applications, such as web browsers and word processors, are multithreaded.",Modern applications avoid multithreading due to its complexity and resource overhead.,"Multithreading is only beneficial for small, specialized utility programs.",C,"The text states that 'Most modern software applications are multithreaded (e.g., web browsers, word processors, image thumbnail generators).'"
"In the context of a busy web server handling thousands of concurrent client requests, what is the primary disadvantage of using a single-threaded server model?",It consumes too many system resources for each client.,It cannot handle any client requests at all.,"It services only one client at a time, leading to long wait times for other clients.",It requires complex inter-process communication mechanisms.,It is less secure than multithreaded models.,C,"A single-threaded server 'services one client at a time, leading to long wait times,' as mentioned in the Web Server Example."
What is a significant drawback of a web server adopting a process-creation method (creating a separate process for each request) compared to a multithreaded approach?,It limits the server to handling only a single client at a time.,It results in less isolation between client requests.,It is generally more efficient for resource sharing.,It is time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the overhead of creating and managing processes.,It prevents the server from leveraging multicore systems effectively.,D,"The text states that the process-creation method is 'time-consuming, resource-intensive,' which makes it less efficient than a multithreaded server."
"Which of the following is listed as a benefit of multithreading that allows an application to remain responsive to the user, even when a part of it is performing a lengthy operation?",Resource Sharing,Economy,Scalability,Responsiveness,Inter-process communication,D,"The 'Responsiveness' benefit specifically states it 'Allows an application to continue running even if part is blocked or performing a lengthy operation,' which 'Increases responsiveness to the user.'"
"How do threads achieve resource sharing, and why is it considered more efficient than traditional Inter-Process Communication (IPC) methods like shared memory or message passing?","Threads require explicit IPC mechanisms, making them more complex.","Threads share memory and resources of their parent process by default, avoiding the overhead of explicit IPC.","Threads only share CPU time, not memory or other resources.",IPC is inherently faster than shared memory.,Resource sharing is not a benefit of multithreading.,B,"The 'Resource Sharing' benefit notes that 'Threads share memory and resources of their parent process by default,' which makes it 'More efficient than inter-process communication (shared memory, message passing).'"
What makes multithreading more 'Economical' compared to managing multiple processes?,Threads are unable to utilize multiple CPU cores.,"It is more economical to create and context-switch threads than processes, consuming less time and memory.",Multithreading eliminates the need for any form of memory management.,Multithreading requires significantly more system memory per task.,Process creation is always faster than thread creation.,B,The 'Economy' benefit states that it is 'More economical to create and context-switch threads than processes' and that 'Thread creation consumes less time and memory than process creation.'
"Which benefit of multithreading is primarily observed in multiprocessor architectures, where it allows different parts of a program to execute simultaneously on different processing cores?",Responsiveness,Resource Sharing,Economy,Scalability,Security,D,"The 'Scalability' benefit highlights 'Greater benefits in multiprocessor architectures, where threads can run in parallel on different processing cores.'"
"According to the text, what is a 'single-threaded' process or program?",A program that can only run on multi-core systems.,A process that has only one thread of control and executes on only one core at a time.,A process that is designed for parallel execution across multiple cores.,A program that shares its CPU utilization unit with other programs.,A process that manages multiple tasks concurrently.,B,The glossary defines 'single-threaded' as 'A process or program that has only one thread of control (and so executes on only one core at a time).'
A 'multithreaded' process or program is characterized by:,"Having a single thread of control, limiting it to one core.",Being unable to share resources with other processes.,"Having multiple threads of control, allowing multiple simultaneous execution points.","Exclusive execution on a single processor, regardless of available cores.",Being less efficient in terms of context switching than single-threaded processes.,C,"The glossary defines 'multithreaded' as 'A term describing a process or program with multiple threads of control, allowing multiple simultaneous execution points.'"
"Which of the following describes a thread as a basic unit of CPU utilization, encompassing its unique components and shared resources?","It is an entire process, including its own separate memory space for all resources.","It comprises a thread ID, a program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack, and shares its code section, data section, and OS resources with other threads of the same process.",It is an independent program that never shares any resources with other threads.,It is a light-weight process that can only execute one instruction at a time.,It is a hardware component responsible for managing CPU cores.,B,"The text and glossary comprehensively define a thread: 'A basic unit of CPU utilization; it comprises a thread ID, a program counter (PC), a register set, and a stack. It shares with other threads belonging to the same process its code section, data section, and other operating-system resources, such as open files and signals.'"
Which of the following is an example of an operating system component mentioned as being multithreaded?,User interface applications like web browsers.,Image thumbnail generators.,Linux kernel threads like `kthreadd` for device and memory management.,Traditional single-threaded processes.,Dedicated database servers running single-threaded operations.,C,"The text states, 'Most OS kernels are multithreaded (e.g., Linux kernel threads like `kthreadd` for device management, memory management, interrupt handling).'"
