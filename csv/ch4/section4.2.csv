"The ""Balance"" challenge in multicore programming refers to:",Balancing the workload between the CPU and GPU.,Ensuring that parallel tasks perform equal work of equal value to justify the use of separate execution cores.,Distributing data evenly across all available memory modules.,Balancing the number of threads with the number of processes.,Balancing the input/output operations with computational tasks.,B,The 'Balance' challenge is defined as 'Ensuring that parallel tasks perform equal work of equal value to justify the use of separate execution cores.'

"Why is ""Data dependency"" considered a key challenge in programming for multicore systems?",It restricts the ability to split data across multiple cores.,It makes identifying tasks much harder.,It requires examining data for dependencies between tasks and ensuring synchronized execution to accommodate these dependencies.,It complicates the process of balancing work among cores.,It is the primary cause of deadlocks in parallel programs.,C,The 'Data dependency' challenge necessitates 'Examining data for dependencies between tasks and ensuring synchronized execution to accommodate these dependencies.'
"Why is ""Testing and debugging"" particularly difficult for parallel programs on multicore systems?",They require specialized hardware not commonly available.,They always produce non-deterministic results.,"They have many possible execution paths, making comprehensive testing challenging.",The programming languages used for them are inherently more complex.,There are no adequate debugging tools available for multithreaded applications.,C,Testing and debugging is 'More difficult due to many possible execution paths in parallel programs.'
What is the primary purpose of Amdahl's Law?,To measure the power consumption of multicore processors.,To predict the optimal number of cores for any given application.,To identify potential performance gains from adding additional computing cores.,To calculate the maximum memory an application can use.,To determine the most efficient scheduling algorithm for parallel tasks.,C,Amdahl's Law is a formula that 'identifies potential performance gains from adding additional computing cores.'
"According to Amdahl's Law, what is the effect of the serial portion of an application on performance gains from adding computing cores?",The serial portion has no significant impact if enough cores are added.,The serial portion can disproportionately affect the performance gained.,"The serial portion primarily affects memory utilization, not speedup.","The smaller the serial portion, the less speedup is possible.",The serial portion only becomes relevant when N (number of cores) is very small.,B,"The text states, ""The serial portion of an application can disproportionately affect the performance gained by adding computing cores."""
"As the number of processing cores (N) approaches infinity, what does the speedup predicted by Amdahl's Law converge to?",Infinity,1,"1/S, where S is the serial portion",1-S,0,C,"The text states, ""As N approaches infinity, the speedup converges to 1/S."""
"An application is 75% parallel and 25% serial (S=0.25). According to Amdahl's Law, approximately what speedup can be expected on a 2-core system (N=2)?",1.2 times,1.6 times,2.0 times,2.28 times,4.0 times,B,Using the formula: speedup â‰¤ 1 / (S + (1 - S)/N) = 1 / (0.25 + (1 - 0.25)/2) = 1 / (0.25 + 0.75/2) = 1 / (0.25 + 0.375) = 1 / 0.625 = 1.6 times.
"Which characteristic best describes ""data parallelism""?","Distributes different tasks to different cores, with each task performing a unique operation.",Focuses on distributing subsets of the same data across multiple computing cores and performing the same operation on each core.,Primarily used for managing data dependencies between unrelated tasks.,A method to convert serial portions of an application into parallel ones.,A technique to balance the workload between CPU and GPU.,B,Data parallelism 'Focuses on distributing subsets of the same data across multiple computing cores.

An application divides a large array into four subsets and assigns each subset to a separate thread. Each thread then calculates the sum of elements within its assigned subset. This is an example of what type of parallelism?,Task parallelism,Instruction-level parallelism,Data parallelism,Concurrency without parallelism,Distributed parallelism,C,This scenario matches the example given for data parallelism: 'Summing elements of an array by dividing the array into subsets for different threads.'
"What is a defining feature of ""task parallelism""?",It requires all threads to operate on identical data sets.,"It distributes subsets of the same data across multiple cores, performing the same operation.","It distributes tasks (threads) across multiple computing cores, with each thread performing a unique operation.",It eliminates the need for data synchronization.,It is primarily concerned with reducing the serial portion of an application.,C,Task parallelism 'Distributes tasks (threads) across multiple computing cores.

Are data parallelism and task parallelism mutually exclusive?,"Yes, an application must choose one or the other exclusively.","No, they are often used interchangeably to refer to the same concept.","Yes, they operate on different hardware architectures.","No, applications may use a hybrid approach combining both.","Yes, one is for single-core systems and the other for multicore.",D,"The text states, 'Data and task parallelism are not mutually exclusive; applications may use a hybrid approach.'"
