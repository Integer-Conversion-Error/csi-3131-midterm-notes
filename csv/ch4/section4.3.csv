What is a major drawback of the One-to-One multithreading model?,It prevents the use of kernel-level scheduling.,"Creating a user thread requires creating a corresponding kernel thread, which can burden system performance.",It does not support blocking system calls.,It is less concurrent than the Many-to-One model.,It is exclusively used for single-core systems.,B,"The text states the drawback: 'Creating a user thread requires creating a corresponding kernel thread, which can burden system performance if too many kernel threads are created.'"
Which operating systems are mentioned as implementations of the One-to-One model?,Solaris and early Java,Green threads and macOS,Linux and Windows,FreeBSD and NetBSD,MS-DOS and Unix,C,"The text indicates that 'Linux, Windows operating systems' are implementations of the One-to-One model."
How does the Many-to-Many multithreading model map user-level threads to kernel threads?,It maps many user-level threads to a larger number of kernel threads.,It maps one user-level thread to one kernel thread.,It maps many user-level threads to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads.,It maps a fixed number of user-level threads to a fixed number of kernel threads.,It bypasses kernel threads entirely.,C,The Many-to-Many model is defined as multiplexing 'many user-level threads to a smaller or equal number of kernel threads.'
"In the Many-to-Many model, how is the number of kernel threads determined?",It is always fixed at one per processor core.,It is always equal to the number of user threads.,It is always determined by the operating system globally.,It can be specific to the application or machine.,It is decided solely by the hardware architecture.,D,"The text notes that 'The number of kernel threads can be specific to the application or machine (e.g., more kernel threads on a system with more cores).'"
What is an advantage of the Many-to-Many model for developers?,It eliminates the need for explicit thread creation.,Developers can create as many user threads as needed.,It enforces a strict limit on the number of user threads.,It ensures that all user threads are bound to a single kernel thread.,It simplifies debugging by reducing concurrency.,B,An advantage listed is that 'Developers can create as many user threads as needed.'
Which characteristic allows the Many-to-Many model to effectively utilize multiprocessors?,It maps all user threads to a single core.,Corresponding kernel threads can run in parallel on a multiprocessor.,It requires manual thread affinity settings.,It only supports sequential execution.,It relies on a single master kernel thread.,B,A stated advantage is that 'Corresponding kernel threads can run in parallel on a multiprocessor.'
How does the Many-to-Many model handle a thread performing a blocking system call?,The entire process blocks until the call completes.,The kernel suspends all other user threads.,The kernel can schedule another thread.,It automatically converts the blocking call to a non-blocking one.,It terminates the blocking thread and restarts it later.,C,"An advantage is that 'When a thread performs a blocking system call, the kernel can schedule another thread.'"
