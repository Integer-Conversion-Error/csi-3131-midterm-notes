Which of the following best describes a user-space thread library?,It requires direct kernel support for all function calls.,Its function calls typically result in system calls to the kernel.,"It is implemented entirely in user space, with function calls being local rather than system calls.",It is exclusively used by operating systems like Windows.,It manages threads by mapping each user thread to a separate kernel thread.,C,"A user-space library is implemented entirely in user space, and its function calls are local, meaning they do not directly involve the kernel through system calls."
In which implementation approach do function calls typically result in system calls to the kernel?,User-space library,Kernel-level library,Hybrid threading model,Asynchronous threading,Java Virtual Machine (JVM) threads,B,"A kernel-level library is supported directly by the operating system, and its function calls typically result in system calls to the kernel for thread management."
Which of the following is NOT listed as a main thread library in the provided text?,POSIX Pthreads,Windows thread library,Java thread API,OpenMP,All of the above are listed.,D,"The text explicitly lists POSIX Pthreads, Windows, and Java as the main thread libraries. OpenMP is not mentioned."
How is the Java thread API typically implemented in relation to the host operating system?,It is an entirely user-space library independent of the host OS.,It always implements its own kernel-level thread management.,"It is implemented using the host system's thread library (e.g., Windows API on Windows, Pthreads on UNIX/Linux/macOS).","It runs threads only within the browser environment, separate from the OS.","It uses a proprietary, custom thread scheduler for all platforms.",C,"The Java thread API is implemented using the host system's thread library, such as the Windows API on Windows or Pthreads on UNIX/Linux/macOS systems."
"Regarding data sharing, how do POSIX Pthreads and Windows threads generally handle global data compared to Java threads?",All three explicitly arrange shared data access.,"POSIX and Windows do not share global data, while Java does.","POSIX and Windows automatically share global data, while Java requires explicit arrangement.","Java has global data similar to C/C++, while POSIX/Windows do not.",None of the above.,C,"POSIX and Windows share global data (declared outside functions) among all threads in the same process, whereas Java has no equivalent of global data and requires shared data access to be explicitly arranged."
"Which threading strategy describes a parent thread creating a child thread and then resuming execution independently, with little data sharing?",Synchronous threading,Parallel threading,Asynchronous threading,Cooperative threading,Detached threading,C,"Asynchronous threading involves the parent creating a child and resuming execution independently, leading to concurrent and independent execution with little data sharing. This is commonly used in multithreaded servers and responsive UIs."
"In synchronous threading, what is a characteristic behavior of the parent thread after creating child threads?","It immediately terminates, leaving child threads to run independently.","It resumes execution concurrently with the child threads, with no waiting.",It waits for all child threads to terminate before it resumes its own execution.,It delegates its remaining tasks to the child threads and then idles.,It only communicates with one child thread at a time.,C,"Synchronous threading is defined as the parent thread creating one or more child threads and waiting for them to terminate before it resumes. This strategy typically involves significant data sharing, such as the parent combining results from children."
What is Pthreads?,A specific implementation of a user-space thread library for macOS.,"The POSIX standard defining an API for thread creation and synchronization, which is a specification, not an implementation.",A proprietary thread library developed by Microsoft for Windows systems.,A Java framework for managing thread pools and asynchronous tasks.,A debugging tool for multi-threaded C++ applications.,B,"Pthreads is the POSIX standard (IEEE 1003.1c) defining an API for thread creation and synchronization. It is a specification, not an implementation itself."
Which header file is typically included in a C program that uses Pthreads?,windows.h,java.util.concurrent,pthread.h,threadlib.h,sys/thread.h,C,The text explicitly states that a basic Pthreads C program example includes 'pthread.h'.
"In Pthreads, which function is used by the parent thread to wait for a child thread to terminate?",pthread_create(),pthread_exit(),pthread_join(),pthread_terminate(),pthread_wait(),C,"The text states that the parent waits for the child thread to terminate using 'pthread_join(tid, NULL)'."
What is the typical method for a child thread to terminate its execution in Pthreads?,Returning from the runner function.,Calling `pthread_terminate()`.,Calling `pthread_exit(0)`.,By the parent thread calling `pthread_cancel()`.,Automatically when its stack is unwound.,C,The text indicates that the child thread terminates by calling 'pthread_exit(0)'.
Which header file is typically included when working with Windows threads?,pthread.h,windows.h,java.lang.Thread,unistd.h,sys/types.h,B,The text states that 'windows.h' is included when working with Windows threads.
"In Windows threads, which function is used to create a new thread?",CreateProcess(),pthread_create(),CreateThread(),new Thread(),StartThread(),C,"The 'CreateThread()' function is used for thread creation in Windows threads, as stated in the text."
How does a parent thread in Windows typically wait for a single child thread to complete its execution?,By calling `WaitForMultipleObjects()`.,By calling `pthread_join()`.,By calling `Sleep()` with a long duration.,"By calling `WaitForSingleObject(ThreadHandle, INFINITE)`.",Windows threads do not support parent-child waiting.,D,"To wait for a single thread in Windows, the function 'WaitForSingleObject(ThreadHandle, INFINITE)' is used."
What is the fundamental model of program execution in Java?,Process-based parallelism.,Single-threaded sequential execution.,The use of 'main()' method exclusively.,"Threads, with every Java program having at least one thread.",Distributed computing via network sockets.,D,"Threads are the fundamental model of program execution in Java, and every Java program has at least one thread (the 'main()' method)."
Which of the following is considered the more common technique for explicit thread creation in Java?,Creating a class derived from `Thread` and overriding its `start()` method.,Defining a class that implements the `Runnable` interface.,Using the `java.util.concurrent.Executor` framework directly without `Runnable`.,Calling `Thread.create()` with a lambda expression.,Extending the `Object` class and implementing a `run()` method.,B,The text states that defining a class that implements the `Runnable` interface is the more common technique for explicit thread creation in Java.
"When creating and executing a Java thread, what method is invoked on the `Thread` object to start the new thread's execution, rather than calling its `run()` method directly?",execute(),init(),run(),start(),go(),D,"After creating a `Thread` object, the `start()` method must be invoked. This allocates memory and initializes a new thread in the JVM, which then calls the `run()` method. Calling `run()` directly executes it in the current thread."
Which Java method is used to wait for the completion of a thread?,wait(),terminate(),join(),yield(),sleep(),C,"The `join()` method is used in Java to wait for thread completion, and it can throw an `InterruptedException`."
What is a key benefit of the Java Executor Framework (`java.util.concurrent`)?,It strictly enforces single-threaded execution.,It provides direct access to kernel-level thread management.,It separates thread creation from execution and offers greater control over thread management.,It compiles Java code into native machine code for faster thread execution.,It automatically converts synchronous tasks into asynchronous ones.,C,"The Java Executor Framework provides greater control over thread creation and communication, separating thread creation from execution, and offering benefits like returning results."
"How can a Java thread return a result from its execution, given that the `run()` method cannot return a value directly?",By declaring shared global data.,By using the `Thread.getReturnValue()` method.,By implementing the `Callable` interface and retrieving results as `Future` objects.,Results can only be returned through asynchronous callbacks.,By extending the `Thread` class and overriding the `returnResult()` method.,C,"The `Callable` interface, similar to `Runnable`, allows returning a result, which is then retrieved as a `Future` object using its `get()` method. The `run()` method of `Runnable` cannot return a result directly."
"Which term is synonymous with 'Lambda expressions' in the context of Java, according to the glossary?",Closure,Synchronous threading,Future object,Thread identifier,API,A,"The glossary defines 'closure' as a construct to provide a simple syntax for parallel applications, also known as Lambda expressions in Java."
