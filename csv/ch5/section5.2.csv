Which statement accurately describes a key characteristic of different CPU-scheduling algorithms?,They all aim to achieve the same optimal performance metrics for every system.,"They have varying properties, favoring certain process classes.",They are designed to equally prioritize both CPU-bound and I/O-bound processes.,"Their properties are identical, differing only in implementation details.",They always minimize CPU utilization to save power.,B,"The text states: 'Different CPU-scheduling algorithms have varying properties, favoring certain process classes.'"
What is the primary factor that determines the choice of a CPU-scheduling algorithm?,The number of concurrent users on the system.,The amount of physical memory available.,The desired characteristics for comparison.,The specific clock speed of the CPU.,The total number of processes in the system.,C,The text indicates: 'The choice of algorithm depends on the desired characteristics for comparison.'
"As a CPU-scheduling criterion, what does 'CPU utilization' specifically aim to achieve?",Minimizing the total power consumed by the CPU.,Keeping the CPU as busy as possible.,Maximizing the time the CPU spends in an idle state.,Ensuring an equal share of CPU time for all processes.,Measuring the number of context switches per second.,B,CPU utilization is defined as an effort to 'Keep the CPU as busy as possible'.
What is considered an ideal range for CPU utilization in real systems?,0-10%,10-20%,20-40%,40-90%,90-100%,D,The text states that CPU utilization is 'ideally 40-90% in real systems'.
"In the context of CPU scheduling, what does the criterion 'throughput' measure?",The total amount of data processed per unit of time.,The number of processes completed per unit time.,The rate at which processes arrive in the ready queue.,The average CPU time allocated to each process.,The number of I/O operations performed per second.,B,Throughput is defined as 'Number of processes completed per unit time'.
Which of the following accurately defines 'turnaround time' in CPU scheduling?,The time a process spends actively executing on the CPU.,The total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.,The time from request submission until the first response is produced.,"The total time from process submission to completion, including waiting in ready queue, CPU execution, and I/O.",The time taken for a process to perform all its I/O operations.,D,"Turnaround time is 'Total time from process submission to completion (includes waiting in ready queue, CPU execution, and I/O)'."
What does 'waiting time' specifically refer to as a CPU-scheduling criterion?,The total time a process spends performing I/O operations.,The time a process waits for system resources other than the CPU.,The total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue.,The time from process submission until it begins execution.,The time elapsed between a request and its first response.,C,Waiting time is defined as 'Total time a process spends waiting in the ready queue'.
For which type of systems is 'response time' a particularly important CPU-scheduling criterion?,Batch processing systems,Embedded systems with fixed tasks,Real-time systems requiring predictable delays,Interactive systems,High-performance computing clusters,D,Response time is defined as 'Time from request submission until the first response is produced (for interactive systems)'.
"When optimizing CPU scheduling criteria, what is the desired goal for 'CPU utilization' and 'throughput'?",Minimize both.,Maximize both.,Minimize CPU utilization and maximize throughput.,Maximize CPU utilization and minimize throughput.,Maintain them at a constant average.,B,The optimization goals state: 'Maximize CPU utilization and throughput'.
"Which of the following is the optimization goal for 'turnaround time', 'waiting time', and 'response time'?",Maximize them.,Minimize them.,Keep them constant.,Ensure they are balanced with throughput.,Allow them to fluctuate for system flexibility.,B,"The optimization goals state: 'Minimize turnaround time, waiting time, and response time'."
"While optimizing CPU scheduling, when might optimizing minimum or maximum values be preferred over optimizing the average measure?",Only when the system is under low load.,"Never, average optimization is always superior.","For guaranteed service requirements, such as minimizing maximum response time.",When the CPU utilization is consistently below 50%.,Only for processes that are entirely CPU-bound.,C,"The text mentions: 'Often, the goal is to optimize the average measure, but sometimes minimum or maximum values are preferred (e.g., minimizing maximum response time for guaranteed service)'."
"For interactive systems, what specific aspect of response time is often considered more important to minimize than the average response time?",Its peak value.,Its standard deviation.,Its variance.,Its maximum value.,Its initial delay.,C,"The text states: 'For interactive systems, minimizing the variance in response time may be more important than minimizing the average'."
"According to the provided glossary, what is the specific definition of 'throughput' in the context of scheduling?",The general amount of work done over time.,The total number of processes submitted to the system.,The number of threads completed per unit time.,The average time spent by threads in the ready queue.,The rate at which the CPU can switch between different threads.,C,The glossary defines 'throughput' in scheduling as 'the number of threads completed per unit time'.
