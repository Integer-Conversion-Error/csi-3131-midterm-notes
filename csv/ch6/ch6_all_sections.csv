Why is CAS-based protection faster under moderate contention compared to traditional locking?,Traditional locking involves simpler code paths.,CAS operations never fail under moderate contention.,"Traditional locking involves complex, time-intensive code paths like suspending threads and context switches, while CAS often succeeds or iterates few times.",CAS inherently eliminates all forms of contention.,Traditional locking automatically scales better.,C,"The text explains, 'CAS operation succeeds most of the time. If it fails, it iterates only a few times before succeeding. Traditional locking: Any contended lock acquisition involves a more complex, time-intensive code path (suspends thread, places on wait queue, context switch).'"
"Under conditions of high contention, which synchronization approach is ultimately faster?",CAS-based synchronization.,Traditional synchronization.,Atomic integers.,Spinlocks.,Reader-writer locks.,B,"The text states, 'High contention: Traditional synchronization is ultimately faster than CAS-based synchronization.'"

More appropriate than mutex locks or semaphores for single updates to shared variables (e.g., counters).'"
In what scenario are spinlocks typically used on multiprocessor systems?,When locks are held for very long durations.,For protecting critical sections that require extensive I/O operations.,When locks are held for short durations.,As a replacement for all other synchronization tools.,On single-processor systems only.,C,"The text states, 'Spinlocks are used on multiprocessor systems when locks are held for short durations.'"
How do mutex locks compare to semaphores in terms of simplicity and overhead?,Semaphores are simpler and have less overhead.,Mutex locks are simpler and have less overhead.,Both have identical simplicity and overhead.,Semaphores are always preferred over mutex locks.,Mutex locks are only used in single-threaded applications.,B,"The text states, 'Mutex locks are simpler and have less overhead than semaphores.'"
