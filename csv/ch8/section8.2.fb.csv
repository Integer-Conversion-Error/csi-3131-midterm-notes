Front,Back
What concept is illustrated by the Pthreads example in multithreaded applications?,Deadlock with POSIX mutex locks.
What is the function of `pthread_mutex_init()`?,Initializes an unlocked mutex.
What is the function of `pthread_mutex_lock()`?,Acquires a lock; blocks if the lock is held.
What is the function of `pthread_mutex_unlock()`?,Releases a lock.
Which two mutex locks are used in the Pthreads deadlock scenario?,"`first_mutex`, `second_mutex`."
Which two threads are involved in the Pthreads deadlock scenario?,"`thread_one`, `thread_two`."
"In the Pthreads deadlock scenario, in what order does `thread_one` acquire locks?","(1) `first_mutex`, (2) `second_mutex`."
"In the Pthreads deadlock scenario, in what order does `thread_two` acquire locks?","(1) `second_mutex`, (2) `first_mutex`."
Describe the condition under which deadlock is possible in the Pthreads scenario with `first_mutex` and `second_mutex`.,"If `thread_one` acquires `first_mutex` and `thread_two` acquires `second_mutex`, both threads will block waiting for the other's lock."
What is a significant characteristic of deadlock occurrence?,It is intermittent.
Why might a potential deadlock not always occur?,If one thread acquires and releases both locks before the other thread starts.
What system component can influence whether a deadlock occurs?,The CPU scheduler.
What difficulty does the intermittent nature of deadlocks present?,Makes identifying and testing for deadlocks difficult.
What kind of failure is livelock classified as?,A liveness failure.
How is livelock similar to deadlock?,Both are liveness failures.
What is a key distinction between livelock and deadlock regarding thread state?,"In livelock, threads are not blocked, unlike deadlock."
Define livelock.,A condition in which a thread continuously attempts an action that fails.
Provide an analogy that illustrates livelock.,"Two people trying to pass in a hallway, repeatedly moving into each other's way. They are active but make no progress."
"Which Pthreads function is used in the livelock example, and what is its purpose?",`pthread_mutex_trylock()` attempts to acquire a lock without blocking.
Describe the livelock scenario involving `pthread_mutex_trylock()` and two threads.,"`thread_one` acquires `first_mutex`, `thread_two` acquires `second_mutex`. Both then call `trylock` on the other mutex, which fails. They release their locks and repeat indefinitely."
What often causes livelock to occur?,When threads retry failing operations at the same time.
How can livelock be avoided?,By having threads retry failing operations at random times.
What real-world example demonstrates a mechanism similar to livelock avoidance?,Ethernet: Hosts involved in a network collision backoff for a random period before retransmitting.
"How common is livelock compared to deadlock, and is it still a concern?","Less common than deadlock, but still a challenge in concurrent application design."
