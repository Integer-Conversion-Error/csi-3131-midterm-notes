What are the four necessary conditions that must hold simultaneously for a deadlock situation to arise?,"Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, and Circular wait.",y
"Define ""Mutual exclusion"" as a necessary condition for deadlock.",At least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode.,y
"Define ""Hold and wait"" as a necessary condition for deadlock.",A thread must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.,y
"Define ""No preemption"" as a necessary condition for deadlock.",A resource can be released only voluntarily by the thread holding it.,y
"Define ""Circular wait"" as a necessary condition for deadlock.","A set of waiting threads {T0, T1, ..., Tn} must exist such that T0 is waiting for a resource held by T1, T1 is waiting for a resource held by T2, ..., Tn-1 is waiting for a resource held by Tn, and Tn is waiting for a resource held by T0.",y
Is it true that all four necessary conditions for deadlock must hold for it to occur?,"Yes, all four conditions (Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, and Circular wait) must hold simultaneously.",y
"Which of the necessary deadlock conditions implies the ""Hold and wait"" condition?",The circular-wait condition.,y
What is a system resource-allocation graph?,A directed graph used for the precise description of deadlocks.,y
What are the two main components of a system resource-allocation graph?,A set of vertices V and a set of edges E.,y
How are the vertices (V) in a system resource-allocation graph partitioned?,Into two types: T (the set of all active threads) and R (the set of all resource types).,y
"Define a ""request edge"" in a system resource-allocation graph.","A directed edge from a thread Ti to a resource type Rj (Ti -> Rj), signifying that Ti has requested an instance of Rj.",y
"Define an ""assignment edge"" in a system resource-allocation graph.","A directed edge from a resource type Rj to a thread Ti (Rj -> Ti), signifying that an instance of Rj has been allocated to Ti.",y
What does it imply if a system resource-allocation graph contains no cycles?,No thread is deadlocked.,y
What does it imply if a system resource-allocation graph contains a cycle?,A deadlock may exist.,y
"In a system resource-allocation graph, if each resource type has exactly one instance and a cycle exists, what does this imply?",A deadlock has occurred.,y
"In a system resource-allocation graph, if each resource type has several instances and a cycle exists, what does this imply?",A cycle is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for deadlock.,y
