Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
What are the three fundamental approaches to handling deadlocks mentioned in the text?,"Prevention, Detection, and Recovery.","Ignore, Prevent/Avoid, and Detect/Recover.","Avoidance, Resolution, and Preemption.","Monitoring, Logging, and Restarting.","Scheduling, Prioritizing, and Terminating.",B,"The text lists 'Ignore problem', 'Prevent/Avoid', and 'Detect/Recover' as the three ways to deal with deadlocks."
Which deadlock handling method is most commonly adopted by operating systems like Linux and Windows?,Deadlock Prevention.,Deadlock Avoidance.,Deadlock Detection and Recovery.,Ignoring the problem.,A combination of Prevention and Avoidance.,D,"The text states that 'Ignore problem' is common due to the infrequency of deadlocks and the cost of other methods, specifically mentioning Linux and Windows."
Why is ignoring the deadlock problem a common solution in many operating systems?,It is the most efficient method to prevent deadlocks from occurring.,Deadlocks are very frequent but easily resolved by users.,"Deadlocks occur infrequently, and other methods are costly.",It guarantees that the system never enters a deadlocked state.,It allows the system to automatically recover without user intervention.,C,The text explicitly states that 'ignoring' is common due to 'infrequency of deadlocks and cost of other methods'.
Which deadlock handling strategy explicitly allows the system to enter a deadlocked state before taking action?,Deadlock Prevention.,Deadlock Avoidance.,Ignoring the problem.,Deadlock Detection and Recovery.,Resource preemption.,D,"The 'Detect/Recover' method is described as allowing the system to 'enter deadlocked state, then detect and recover'."
Which type of systems are specifically mentioned as typically employing the Deadlock Detection and Recovery method?,General-purpose desktop operating systems.,Real-time embedded systems.,Database systems.,Mobile operating systems.,Web servers.,C,The text provides 'databases' as an example of systems that use 'Detect/Recover'.
"What is the primary goal of Deadlock Prevention, as defined in the text?",To provide advance information to the OS about resource requests.,To allow the system to enter a deadlocked state for later recovery.,To ensure at least one necessary condition for deadlock cannot hold.,To detect deadlocks quickly after they occur.,To manually restart the system upon deadlock detection.,C,The glossary defines 'deadlock prevention' as 'Methods to ensure at least one necessary condition for deadlock cannot hold.'
How does Deadlock Prevention prevent deadlocks from occurring?,By providing the OS with advance information on resource use.,By examining the system state to determine if a deadlock occurred.,By constraining resource request methods.,By allowing resources to be preempted from processes.,By recovering the system after a deadlock has formed.,C,The text states Deadlock Prevention 'Prevents deadlocks by constraining resource request methods'.
"For Deadlock Avoidance, what kind of information is provided to the OS in advance?",Current CPU utilization of all threads.,Memory usage limits for each thread.,The resources a thread will request/use.,The priority levels of various system processes.,Network bandwidth requirements for future operations.,C,Deadlock Avoidance is described as the OS being 'given advance info on resources a thread will request/use'.
"When the OS employs Deadlock Avoidance, which of the following is NOT one of the factors it considers to decide if a resource request can be satisfied or delayed?",Currently available resources.,Resources allocated to each thread.,Future requests/releases of each thread.,The total number of CPU cores in the system.,Information provided in advance by the threads.,D,"The text explicitly lists 'Currently available resources', 'Resources allocated to each thread', and 'Future requests/releases of each thread' as factors considered by the OS. The number of CPU cores is not mentioned."
What is the definition of 'deadlock avoidance' according to the provided glossary?,Methods to ensure at least one necessary condition for deadlock cannot hold.,"Allowing the system to enter a deadlocked state, then detecting and recovering.",OS method where processes inform OS of resource use; system approves/denies requests to avoid deadlock.,A common approach in most OS due to the infrequency of deadlocks.,Algorithms designed to examine system state to determine if deadlock occurred and recover from it.,C,The glossary defines 'deadlock avoidance' as 'OS method where processes inform OS of resource use; system approves/denies requests to avoid deadlock.'
Under what circumstances would a system primarily rely on Deadlock Detection and Recovery?,As a primary proactive measure to prevent all deadlocks.,When deadlocks are exceptionally rare and insignificant.,If no prevention or avoidance methods are currently in place.,To minimize the cost associated with resource allocation.,When the system design mandates immediate resolution of all resource conflicts.,C,"The text states: 'If no prevention/avoidance, deadlock may arise,' implying detection and recovery is used in such cases."
The algorithms provided by a system for Deadlock Detection and Recovery are designed to perform which two main functions?,Constrain resource requests and allocate resources safely.,Receive advance information and approve/deny requests.,Examine system state to determine if deadlock occurred and recover from it.,Ignore deadlocks and then restart the system manually.,Prioritize threads and preempt resources when necessary.,C,The text specifies that the algorithms are for 'Examine system state to determine if deadlock occurred' and 'Recover from deadlock'.
Which of the following is a primary outcome if a deadlock remains undetected in a system?,The system automatically and immediately resolves the resource conflicts.,Improved overall system performance due to efficient resource locking.,Resources are automatically released after a short timeout period.,"System performance deteriorates, resources remain held, leading eventually to a manual restart.",The system enters a safe state where no new deadlocks can form spontaneously.,D,"The text explicitly states that 'Undetected deadlock: system performance deteriorates, resources held, more threads deadlock. Eventually, manual restart needed.'"
"What other type of system failure's manual recovery method might be applied for deadlock recovery, according_to the text?",System crash due to hardware failure.,Memory leak leading to out-of-memory errors.,"Livelock, which is a type of liveness failure.",Data corruption during file operations.,Process starvation due to low priority.,C,"The text mentions: 'Manual recovery for other liveness failures (e.g., livelock) may be used for deadlock recovery.'"
