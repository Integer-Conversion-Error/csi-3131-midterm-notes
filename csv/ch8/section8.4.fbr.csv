What are the three main ways to deal with deadlocks?,"Ignore the problem, Prevent/Avoid, and Detect/Recover.",y
Which operating systems commonly ignore the deadlock problem?,"Most OS, such as Linux and Windows.",y
Why is ignoring the deadlock problem a common solution in many operating systems?,Due to the infrequency of deadlocks and the high cost of implementing other methods.,y
What is the core principle of the 'Prevent/Avoid' approach to deadlocks?,To use a protocol to ensure the system never enters a deadlocked state.,y
What is the core principle of the 'Detect/Recover' approach to deadlocks?,"To allow the system to enter a deadlocked state, then detect it and recover.",y
Which systems commonly use the 'Detect/Recover' approach for deadlocks?,"Some systems, such as databases.",y
Can different deadlock handling approaches be combined?,"Yes, basic approaches can be combined for an optimal solution per resource class.",y
deadlock prevention,Methods to ensure at least one necessary condition for deadlock cannot hold.,y
How does Deadlock Prevention prevent deadlocks?,By constraining resource request methods.,y
deadlock avoidance,"An OS method where processes inform the OS of resource use, and the system approves or denies requests to avoid deadlock.",y
What advance information does the OS need for Deadlock Avoidance?,Information on resources a thread will request/use.,y
What factors does the OS consider when deciding to satisfy or delay a resource request in Deadlock Avoidance?,"Currently available resources, resources allocated to each thread, and future requests/releases of each thread.",y
When might Deadlock Detection and Recovery be necessary?,If no prevention or avoidance mechanisms are in place.,y
What two main algorithms does a system provide for Deadlock Detection and Recovery?,Algorithms to examine the system state to determine if deadlock occurred and to recover from deadlock.,y
What are the consequences of an undetected deadlock?,"System performance deteriorates, resources are held, more threads deadlock, and eventually, a manual restart is needed.",y
"Besides specific deadlock recovery algorithms, what other method might be used for deadlock recovery?","Manual recovery for other liveness failures (e.g., livelock).",y
