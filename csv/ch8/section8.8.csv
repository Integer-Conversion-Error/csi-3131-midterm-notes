Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
"When a deadlock is detected in a system, what are the two primary high-level options for recovery?",Increase system resources or perform a system reboot.,Inform the operator for manual intervention or allow the system to recover automatically.,Implement a resource ordering scheme or decrease the number of active processes.,Initiate a full system backup or restart all services.,Isolate the deadlocked threads or implement a timeout mechanism.,B,"The text states that when deadlock is detected, the options are to 'Inform operator (manual recovery)' or for the 'System recovers automatically.'"
Which two specific methods are identified for actively breaking a detected deadlock?,Implementing a banker's algorithm and resource allocation graph.,Increasing process priorities and allowing threads to self-terminate.,"Aborting one or more threads, or preempting resources from deadlocked threads.",Rolling back all transactions and forcing a context switch.,Reducing the number of available resources and blocking new process creation.,C,The text explicitly lists 'Abort one or more threads (break circular wait)' and 'Preempt resources from deadlocked threads' as the two options for breaking deadlock.
"When a process or thread is aborted as a method to eliminate a deadlock, what happens to the resources it was holding?",They remain allocated to the aborted process for a grace period.,They are immediately reallocated to other waiting processes.,The system reclaims all resources held by the aborted entity.,They are put into a pending state until manual intervention.,They are transferred to a quarantine area to prevent further issues.,C,"The text states, 'System reclaims all resources' when a process/thread is aborted."
What is a significant drawback of choosing to 'abort all deadlocked processes' as a deadlock recovery method?,It may not break the deadlock cycle immediately.,It leads to low overhead as all processes are treated uniformly.,It is expensive due to discarded computations and the need for recomputation.,"It primarily affects only the resources, not the processes themselves.",It requires continuous deadlock detection after each abort.,C,"The text states that 'Abort all deadlocked processes' is 'expensive (discarded computations, recomputation needed).'"
Why does the method of 'abort one process at a time until deadlock eliminated' have high overhead?,It requires complex resource preemption strategies.,It involves discarding all system-wide computations.,It necessitates deadlock-detection after each individual abort.,It often results in file and shared data integrity issues.,It can lead to system-wide starvation of processes.,C,The text indicates that 'Abort one process at a time until deadlock eliminated' has 'High overhead (deadlock-detection after each abort).'
What issue can arise if a process that is currently updating a file is aborted during deadlock recovery?,The file will be permanently deleted from the system.,The file may remain in an incorrect or inconsistent state.,The system will automatically create a backup of the file.,The file's access permissions will be corrupted.,"The file will be locked indefinitely, preventing any further access.",B,The text lists 'File in incorrect state if updating' as an issue when aborting processes.
"If a process updating shared data while holding a mutex lock is aborted during deadlock recovery, what is a primary concern?",The mutex lock will be permanently lost.,Other processes will immediately gain access to the data.,"Shared data integrity issues may occur, and the lock status must be restored.",The system will automatically reinitialize all shared data.,It will trigger a complete system reboot.,C,The text notes 'Shared data integrity issues if updating while holding mutex lock (must restore lock status)' as a concern.
"In the context of partial termination for deadlock recovery, how is the specific process to be terminated typically determined?",Randomly selected by the system.,The process that has been running the longest.,"Based on a policy decision, often economic in nature.",The process that is holding the fewest resources.,The process with the lowest CPU utilization.,C,"The text states that determining which process to terminate is a 'policy decision, economic.'"
"Which of the following is explicitly listed as a factor for choosing a victim process to terminate during deadlock recovery, aiming to minimize cost?",The process's network bandwidth usage.,The process's input/output operations per second.,The process's priority.,The process's total memory footprint.,The process's average response time.,C,'Process priority' is explicitly listed as a factor for choosing a victim to minimize cost.
"When selecting a victim process to terminate, what aspect of 'computation time' is considered to minimize cost?",Only the future projected computation time.,Only the past historical average computation time.,How long the process has computed and how much longer it needs.,The peak computation time achieved by the process.,The time spent waiting for I/O operations.,C,"The text specifies 'Computation time (how long computed, how much longer)' as a factor for choosing a victim."
"Which characteristic of 'Resources used' is relevant when choosing a victim for deadlock termination, aiming for minimum cost?",The absolute monetary value of the resources.,The types of resources and their ease of preemption.,Whether the resources are shared or exclusive.,The total number of unique resources held.,The age of the resources allocated.,B,"The text lists 'Resources used (types, ease of preemption)' as a factor for choosing a victim."
"In the context of deadlock recovery, what does 'resource preemption' primarily involve?",Preventing processes from acquiring new resources.,Allowing processes to voluntarily release resources.,Successively taking resources from processes and giving them to others until the deadlock is broken.,Limiting the total number of resources available in the system.,Reordering resource requests to avoid circular wait.,C,"The text defines resource preemption as 'Successively preempt resources from processes, give to others until deadlock broken.'"
"When performing resource preemption, what is the primary objective when 'selecting a victim' process or resource?",To ensure the highest priority process is always selected.,"To minimize the cost, such as resources held or time consumed.",To select the process that has used the least amount of CPU time.,To always preempt resources that are easy to reclaim.,To avoid selecting any process that is performing I/O.,B,"The text states, 'Selecting a victim: Which resources/processes to preempt? Minimize cost (e.g., resources held, time consumed).'"
"If a process has its resources preempted during deadlock recovery, what is the immediate consequence regarding its execution?",It can continue normal execution but with reduced performance.,It must roll back to a safe state and restart its operation.,It is immediately terminated without any further action.,It waits indefinitely for the preempted resources to become available.,It enters a recovery mode where it can request new resources.,B,"The text states that a preempted process 'Cannot continue normal execution (missing resource)' and must 'Roll back to safe state, restart.'"
What is considered the simplest method for rollback when a process has its resources preempted?,Partial rollback to the last checkpoint.,Selective restoration of only critical resources.,"Total rollback, which involves aborting and restarting the process.",Waiting for the system to automatically restore the process state.,Initiating a recovery mode boot.,C,"The text describes 'Simplest: total rollback (abort, restart).'"
"For a more effective rollback strategy in resource preemption, what is generally required from the system?",Less system state information.,The ability to roll back only as necessary.,A simpler recovery mode.,Avoiding any form of process restart.,Preempting all resources from all processes.,B,"The text states, 'More effective: roll back only as necessary (requires more state info).'"
What is a common solution to prevent starvation when continuously preempting resources from processes during deadlock recovery?,Randomly selecting processes for preemption.,Setting a maximum limit on the number of resources a process can hold.,Including the number of rollbacks in the cost factor for victim selection.,"Implementing a first-come, first-served resource allocation policy.",Prioritizing processes that have never been preempted before.,C,"The text suggests, 'Common solution: include number of rollbacks in cost factor' to ensure a process is picked as a victim a finite number of times."
"According to the provided glossary, what is the primary purpose of 'recovery mode'?",To provide full system services for normal operation.,To allow users to create new system configurations.,To enable system administrators to repair system problems and debug system startup.,To automatically restore data from the last backup.,To monitor system performance under heavy load.,C,The glossary defines 'recovery mode' as 'A system boot state providing limited services and designed to enable the system admin to repair system problems and debug system startup.'
