What are the two general options when deadlock is detected?,Inform operator (manual recovery); System recovers automatically.,y
What are the two primary options for breaking a deadlock?,Abort one or more threads (to break circular wait); Preempt resources from deadlocked threads.,y
How can deadlocks be eliminated through process/thread termination?,"By aborting one or more processes or threads, which allows the system to reclaim all their held resources.",y
Describe the 'Abort all deadlocked processes' method for resolving deadlock.,This method immediately breaks the deadlock cycle but is expensive due to discarded computations and the need for recomputation.,y
Describe the 'Abort one process at a time until deadlock eliminated' method for resolving deadlock.,"This method involves aborting processes sequentially until the deadlock is resolved, but it incurs high overhead because deadlock detection must be performed after each abort.",y
What are potential issues when aborting a process to resolve a deadlock?,"Files may be left in an incorrect state if they were being updated; Shared data integrity issues can arise if the process was updating data while holding a mutex lock, requiring the lock status to be restored.",y
What factors influence the decision of which process to terminate during partial termination to resolve a deadlock?,"It is a policy decision, often based on economic factors to minimize cost.",y
"List the factors considered when choosing a victim process to terminate for deadlock recovery, aiming for minimum cost.","Process priority; Computation time (how long computed, how much longer); Resources used (types, ease of preemption); Resources needed to complete; Number of processes to terminate.",y
What is the concept of 'resource preemption' in deadlock recovery?,It involves successively taking resources away from one or more processes and allocating them to others until the deadlock is broken.,y
What is the 'selecting a victim' issue in resource preemption for deadlock recovery?,"It involves determining which resources or processes to preempt, with the goal of minimizing the cost (e.g., considering resources held or time consumed).",y
Explain the 'rollback' issue in resource preemption for deadlock recovery.,"A preempted process cannot continue normal execution due to missing resources. The solution is to roll the process back to a safe state and restart it. This can be a total rollback (abort and restart) or a more effective partial rollback (only as necessary), which requires more state information.",y
What are the two main approaches to 'rollback' in resource preemption for deadlock recovery?,"Total rollback (simplest, involves aborting and restarting the process); Partial rollback (more effective, involves rolling back only as necessary, requires more state information).",y
Describe the 'starvation' issue in resource preemption for deadlock recovery.,"Starvation occurs if resources are always preempted from the same process, preventing it from ever completing its execution.",y
How is the 'starvation' issue typically addressed in resource preemption for deadlock recovery?,By ensuring that a process is picked as a victim only a finite number of times. A common solution is to include the number of times a process has been rolled back in the cost factor used for victim selection.,y
Define 'recovery mode'.,A system boot state that provides limited services and is designed to enable the system administrator to repair system problems and debug system startup.,y
