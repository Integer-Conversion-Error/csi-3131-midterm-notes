Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
"In the context of operating systems, what is the definition of a deadlock?",A state where a process continuously acquires and releases resources without making progress.,A set of processes where each process is waiting for an event that can only be caused by another process within that same set.,An error state where a process terminates unexpectedly due to a resource conflict.,"A condition where a single process holds all available resources, preventing others from running.",A mechanism used by the operating system to prioritize important processes over less critical ones.,B,"The text defines a deadlock as a 'set of processes, each waiting for event caused by another process in set.'"
Which of the following is NOT listed as one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur?,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,Resource sharing,No preemption,Circular wait,C,"The four necessary conditions for deadlock are Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, and Circular wait. Resource sharing is not one of them."
"For a deadlock to be possible, which of the following statements must be true regarding the four necessary conditions?",At least one of the conditions must be present for a deadlock to initiate.,Only two of the four conditions are strictly required for a deadlock to form.,All four conditions must be present simultaneously for a deadlock to be possible.,"The conditions are only relevant for deadlock prevention, not for the occurrence itself.",The presence of any single condition is enough to guarantee a deadlock.,C,"The text explicitly states, 'Deadlock only possible if all four conditions present.'"
"How are deadlocks typically modeled, and what characteristic within this model indicates the presence of a deadlock?",Using process flowcharts; a linear progression without branches.,Using resource-allocation graphs; the presence of a cycle.,Using system call tables; a high number of repeated system calls.,Using memory usage diagrams; a significant spike in memory consumption.,Using CPU scheduling algorithms; a consistently low CPU utilization rate.,B,"The text states, 'Deadlocks modeled with resource-allocation graphs; cycle indicates deadlock.'"
"Which necessary condition for deadlock implies that at least one resource must be held in a non-sharable mode, meaning only one process at a time can use it?",Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Mutual exclusion,Resource availability,D,"Mutual exclusion refers to resources that cannot be shared simultaneously, meaning only one process can use them at a time."
A process currently holds a file lock and is waiting to acquire access to a database record that is currently held by another process. This scenario exemplifies which necessary condition for deadlock?,Circular wait,No preemption,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,Resource preemption,D,Hold and wait means a process holds at least one resource and is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
Which necessary condition for deadlock dictates that resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process; they must be released voluntarily by the process holding them upon completion?,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Resource sharing,C,No preemption means resources cannot be forcibly taken from a process; they must be released voluntarily.
"In a system, Process P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, P2 is waiting for a resource held by P3, and P3 is waiting for a resource held by P1. This chain represents which necessary condition for deadlock?",Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Resource preemption,Circular wait,E,"Circular wait describes a chain of processes, each waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain, forming a closed loop."
What is the fundamental approach of deadlock prevention?,To detect deadlocks once they occur and initiate a recovery procedure.,To allow deadlocks to happen but ensure a rapid and efficient recovery process.,To ensure that at least one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur.,To always grant resource requests as long as resources are physically available.,To run a detection algorithm periodically to find and log deadlocked states.,C,Deadlock prevention strategies aim to 'ensure one of four conditions cannot occur.'
Which of the four necessary conditions for deadlock is explicitly mentioned as the most practical to eliminate in a deadlock prevention strategy?,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Resource preemption,D,The text specifies 'Practical prevention: eliminate circular wait.'
Which algorithm is specifically mentioned as being used for deadlock avoidance?,"First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm",Round Robin (RR) algorithm,Banker's algorithm,Priority Scheduling algorithm,Least Recently Used (LRU) algorithm,C,Deadlock avoidance is implemented using the 'banker's algorithm'.
The core principle guiding resource allocation in deadlock avoidance is to:,Allow processes to hold resources indefinitely until explicitly released.,Grant resource requests only if doing so will not lead the system into an unsafe state.,Preempt resources from any process that has been waiting for a resource for a prolonged period.,Immediately terminate any process identified as being part of a circular wait.,Always grant resource requests to maximize system throughput and resource utilization.,B,Deadlock avoidance involves not granting resources if doing so 'leads to unsafe state'.
What is the primary function of a deadlock detection algorithm?,To prevent any of the four necessary deadlock conditions from occurring in the first place.,To dynamically allocate resources in a way that avoids entering an unsafe state.,To evaluate processes and resources on a running system to identify if a deadlocked state currently exists.,To recover from a deadlock by automatically aborting all involved processes.,To ensure mutual exclusion for all critical resources in the system.,C,Deadlock detection involves an 'algorithm evaluates processes/resources on running system to find deadlocked state'.
Which of the following is a direct method for deadlock recovery?,Implementing a strict preemption policy for all resources.,Continuously checking for safe states using the Banker's algorithm.,Aborting one process that is part of the circular wait condition.,Allowing processes to complete their execution regardless of their state.,Increasing the number of available resources dynamically.,C,One recovery method listed is 'Abort one process in circular wait'.
"In addition to aborting processes, what is another method of deadlock recovery mentioned?","Granting all pending resource requests immediately, even if it leads to an unsafe state.",Disabling mutual exclusion for all resources system-wide.,Preempting resources that have been assigned to a deadlocked process.,Restarting the entire operating system to clear all resource allocations.,Delaying all new process creations until the system becomes idle.,C,The other recovery method listed is 'Preempt resources assigned to deadlocked process'.
