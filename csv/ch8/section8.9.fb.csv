What is a deadlock?,A set of processes where each process is waiting for an event caused by another process in the set.
What are the four necessary conditions for deadlock?,"Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, Circular wait."
Define Mutual Exclusion in the context of deadlocks.,Only one process at a time can use a resource.
Define Hold and Wait in the context of deadlocks.,A process holding at least one resource is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.
Define No Preemption in the context of deadlocks.,"A resource can only be released voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task."
Define Circular Wait in the context of deadlocks.,"A set of processes {P0, P1, ..., Pn} exists such that P0 is waiting for a resource held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, ..., Pn-1 is waiting for a resource held by Pn, and Pn is waiting for a resource held by P0."
When is deadlock only possible?,"Only if all four necessary conditions (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, circular wait) are present."
How are deadlocks typically modeled?,Using resource-allocation graphs.
What indicates a deadlock in a resource-allocation graph?,A cycle in the graph.
What is the goal of deadlock prevention?,To ensure that at least one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur.
What is a practical strategy for deadlock prevention?,Eliminating circular wait.
What is the strategy for deadlock avoidance?,Using the Banker's Algorithm to not grant resources if doing so would lead to an unsafe state.
What is the strategy for deadlock detection?,An algorithm that evaluates processes and resources on a running system to find a deadlocked state.
What are two methods for deadlock recovery?,"Aborting one process in a circular wait, or preempting resources assigned to a deadlocked process."
Describe one method for deadlock recovery related to processes.,Aborting one process that is part of the circular wait.
Describe one method for deadlock recovery related to resources.,Preempting resources that are assigned to a deadlocked process.
