What is a deadlock?,A set of processes where each process is waiting for an event caused by another process in the set.,y
List the four necessary conditions for a deadlock to occur.,"Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, Circular wait.",y
When is a deadlock possible?,"Only if all four necessary conditions (mutual exclusion, hold and wait, no preemption, and circular wait) are present simultaneously.",y
How are deadlocks modeled?,With resource-allocation graphs.,y
What indicates a deadlock in a resource-allocation graph?,A cycle in the graph.,y
What is the goal of deadlock prevention?,To ensure that one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock cannot occur.,y
What is a practical method for deadlock prevention?,Eliminating circular wait.,y
What is deadlock avoidance?,A method that uses algorithms to avoid granting resources if doing so would lead to an unsafe state.,y
Which algorithm is commonly used for deadlock avoidance?,Banker's algorithm.,y
What is deadlock detection?,An algorithm that evaluates processes and resources on a running system to find a deadlocked state.,y
What are the two main methods for deadlock recovery?,"Aborting one process in a circular wait, or preempting resources assigned to a deadlocked process.",y
