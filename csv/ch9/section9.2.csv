"In contiguous memory allocation, what is the fundamental characteristic of how each process is stored in main memory?",Each process is divided into multiple non-contiguous segments.,"Each process resides in a single, unbroken section of memory.","Processes are stored in fixed-size blocks, regardless of their actual size.","Memory is dynamically allocated to processes as needed, without fixed partitions.",Processes share a single memory partition to maximize utilization.,B,Contiguous memory allocation is defined as a method where each process is in a single contiguous memory section.
Main memory in a system using contiguous memory allocation is typically divided into two partitions. What do these two partitions accommodate?,"One for user data, one for system files.","One for active processes, one for swapped-out processes.","One for the operating system, one for user processes.","One for kernel modules, one for device drivers.","One for read-only memory, one for read-write memory.",C,"The text states: 'Memory usually divided into two partitions: one for OS, one for user processes.'"

What is the primary goal of memory protection in a contiguous memory allocation scheme?,To optimize memory access speed.,To prevent a process from accessing memory that does not belong to it.,To allow dynamic resizing of memory partitions.,To facilitate efficient context switching between processes.,To ensure all memory is fully utilized at all times.,B,Memory protection's purpose is to 'Prevent process from accessing unowned memory.'
Which two registers are combined to implement memory protection in a system using contiguous memory allocation?,Program Counter and Stack Pointer.,Instruction Register and Memory Buffer Register.,Relocation Register and Limit Register.,Base Register and Index Register.,Segment Register and Offset Register.,C,Memory protection is implemented by combining a 'relocation register (smallest physical address) and limit register (range of logical addresses).'
"In the context of memory protection, what information does the 'relocation register' hold?",The largest physical address a process can access.,The range of logical addresses for a process.,The smallest physical address where a process's memory segment begins.,The current size of the operating system.,The address of the next instruction to be executed.,C,The relocation register stores the 'smallest physical address'.
How does the Memory Management Unit (MMU) dynamically map a logical address to a physical address using the relocation-register scheme?,It subtracts the limit register value from the logical address.,It multiplies the logical address by the relocation register value.,It adds the relocation register value to the logical address.,It divides the logical address by the limit register value.,It uses a lookup table to find the corresponding physical address.,C,The MMU maps logical addresses dynamically by 'adding relocation register value'.
When are the relocation and limit registers updated in a system utilizing this memory protection scheme?,Once at system startup and remain fixed.,Periodically by the operating system kernel.,During every CPU instruction fetch.,By the CPU scheduler during each context switch.,Only when a new process is loaded into memory.,D,The 'CPU scheduler loads relocation and limit registers during context switch'.
A significant benefit of the relocation-register scheme is its ability to allow what regarding the operating system?,For the OS to run entirely from read-only memory.,For the OS to be swapped out to disk when not in use.,For the OS size to change dynamically.,For the OS to reside in low memory exclusively.,For the OS to share memory partitions with user processes freely.,C,The 'Relocation-register scheme allows dynamic OS size changes'.
Which of the following is characteristic of the 'variable-partition' memory-allocation scheme?,Memory is divided into fixed-size partitions beforehand.,Each memory partition contains exactly one process.,Processes can occupy multiple non-contiguous partitions.,Only one process can reside in memory at a time.,The size of partitions is determined by the largest process.,B,The definition states: 'Each partition contains exactly one process (variable-partition scheme).'
"In a variable-partition memory allocation scheme, what is a 'hole'?",A section of memory reserved for the operating system.,A contiguous section of unused memory available for allocation.,"A small, fixed-size block of memory allocated to a process.",An area of memory currently being used by a terminated process.,A buffer used for inter-process communication.,B,A 'hole' is defined as 'a contiguous section of unused memory'.
What is the initial state of memory available for user processes in a variable-partition scheme?,It is completely occupied by a dummy process.,"It contains many small, scattered holes.","It consists of a single large block, known as a 'hole'.",It is divided into a predetermined number of fixed-size partitions.,It is entirely allocated to the operating system.,C,"Initially: 'all memory available for user processes, one large block (hole).'"
The challenge of satisfying a memory request of a given size from a list of free holes is an instance of what problem?,The producer-consumer problem.,The synchronization problem.,The dynamic storage-allocation problem.,The critical section problem.,The dining philosophers problem.,C,The text states: 'This procedure: instance of dynamic storage-allocation problem.'
Which memory allocation strategy involves allocating the first hole in the list that is large enough to satisfy the memory request?,Best-fit,Worst-fit,First-fit,Next-fit,Optimal-fit,C,First-fit is defined as: 'Allocate first hole big enough.'
"Which memory allocation strategy searches the entire list of free holes to find the smallest hole that is large enough for the request, often resulting in the smallest leftover hole?",First-fit,Worst-fit,Best-fit,Round-robin,Least-fit,C,Best-fit is defined as: 'Allocate smallest hole big enough. ... Produces smallest leftover hole.'
The 'Worst-fit' memory allocation strategy is characterized by selecting which type of hole for allocation?,The smallest hole that is big enough.,"The first available hole, regardless of size.",The hole that has been free for the longest time.,The largest available hole.,The hole closest to the operating system's memory partition.,D,Worst-fit is defined as: 'Allocate largest hole.'

"Regarding storage utilization, what is the comparative performance between 'first-fit' and 'best-fit' strategies?",Best-fit is always superior for storage utilization.,First-fit is always superior for storage utilization.,"Neither is clearly better for storage utilization, but first-fit is generally faster.",Both strategies result in identical storage utilization.,Storage utilization is not a relevant metric for these strategies.,C,"'Neither first-fit nor best-fit clearly better for storage utilization, but first-fit generally faster.'"
"Which type of memory fragmentation occurs when there is enough total free memory to satisfy a request, but it is broken into many small, non-contiguous pieces?",Internal fragmentation.,Paging fragmentation.,External fragmentation.,Compaction fragmentation.,Process fragmentation.,C,"External fragmentation is defined as: 'enough total memory, but spaces not contiguous (storage fragmented).'"
