What does main memory accommodate?,The Operating System (OS) and user processes.
How is memory usually divided for the OS and user processes?,"Into two partitions: one for the OS, and one for user processes."
Where can the OS reside in memory?,"In low or high memory. Many OS, including Linux/Windows, use high memory."
How many user processes typically reside in memory concurrently?,Several.
Define Contiguous Memory Allocation.,A memory allocation method where each process is in a single contiguous memory section.
What is the primary goal of memory protection?,To prevent a process from accessing memory it does not own.
Which two registers are combined to implement memory protection?,The relocation register and the limit register.
What is the purpose of the relocation register in memory protection?,It holds the smallest physical address (base address) that a process can access.
What is the purpose of the limit register in memory protection?,It specifies the range of logical addresses that a process can access.
How is a logical address validated in a relocation-register scheme?,Each logical address must fall within the range specified by the limit register.
How does the MMU (Memory Management Unit) map a logical address dynamically using the relocation-register scheme?,By adding the relocation register's value to the logical address.
What is the CPU scheduler's role regarding relocation and limit registers during a context switch?,It loads the relocation and limit registers.
When are CPU-generated addresses checked against the relocation and limit registers?,Every CPU-generated address is checked.
What does the relocation-register scheme allow regarding OS size?,Dynamic changes to the OS size.
Why is the relocation-register scheme desirable for device drivers?,It allows them to be loaded only when needed and removed when no longer needed.
What is the simplest method for memory allocation?,Assigning processes to variably sized partitions.
Define Variable-Partition scheme.,A memory-allocation scheme where each memory partition contains exactly one process.
What does the OS keep track of regarding memory parts in variable-partition allocation?,A table of available and occupied memory parts.
What is the initial state of memory for user processes in a variable-partition scheme?,"All memory is available for user processes as one large block, known as a 'hole'."
What does memory contain after some processes have been loaded and removed?,A set of 'holes' of various sizes scattered throughout memory.
What does the OS consider when a process arrives and requires memory?,Its memory requirements and the available space (holes).
What happens if a process terminates and releases its memory block?,"The OS provides the released memory to another process, and the block is returned to the set of available 'holes'."
What action is taken if a new hole is adjacent to existing holes upon process termination?,The new hole is merged with the adjacent ones to form a larger hole.
Define Dynamic Storage-Allocation Problem.,The problem of satisfying a memory request of size 'n' from a list of free 'holes'.
Name the three common strategies for selecting a free 'hole' in memory allocation.,"First-fit, Best-fit, and Worst-fit."
Define First-Fit in memory allocation.,"In memory allocation, selecting the first hole large enough for a request, searching from the beginning or the last search end. The search stops when a large enough hole is found."
Define Best-Fit in memory allocation.,"In memory allocation, selecting the smallest hole large enough for a request."
Define Worst-Fit in memory allocation.,"In memory allocation, selecting the largest hole available."
What is typically required when using the Best-Fit strategy?,The entire list of holes must be searched (unless ordered by size).
What kind of leftover hole does Best-fit allocation produce?,The smallest leftover hole.
What kind of leftover hole does Worst-fit allocation produce?,The largest leftover hole.
How do First-fit and Best-fit compare to Worst-fit in simulations?,"First-fit and Best-fit are generally better than Worst-fit, both in terms of decreasing time and improving storage utilization."
"Which memory allocation strategy, First-fit or Best-fit, is generally faster?",First-fit.
Define External Fragmentation.,"A type of fragmentation where available memory has holes that together are enough to satisfy a request, but no single hole is large enough. The storage is fragmented and non-contiguous."
How does external fragmentation occur?,"When processes are loaded and removed from memory, free memory is broken into many small, noncontiguous pieces."
What is the 50-percent rule in memory fragmentation?,"A statistical finding that for N allocated blocks, 0.5 N blocks are lost to fragmentation, meaning one-third of memory may become unusable."
What are the two types of memory fragmentation?,Internal fragmentation and external fragmentation.
Define Internal Fragmentation.,Unused memory that is internal to a partition.
When does internal fragmentation occur?,"When allocated memory is slightly larger than the requested memory (e.g., in fixed-sized blocks)."
What is a common solution to external fragmentation?,Compaction.
Define Compaction in memory management.,Shuffling storage contents to consolidate all used space and create one or more large contiguous blocks of free memory (holes).
Under what condition is compaction possible?,Only if relocation is dynamic (execution time). It is not possible if relocation is static (assembly/load time).
What actions are required during compaction if dynamic relocation is enabled?,Move the program/data and change the base register.
Is compaction generally expensive or inexpensive?,"It can be expensive (e.g., moving all processes to one end)."
What is another solution to external fragmentation besides compaction?,Permitting a noncontiguous logical address space.
Which common memory-management technique permits noncontiguous logical address space to solve external fragmentation?,Paging.
What is the most common memory-management technique?,Paging.
