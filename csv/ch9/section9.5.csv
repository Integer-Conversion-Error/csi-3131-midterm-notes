Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
What is the primary reason process instructions and data are temporarily 'swapped' out of main memory?,To permanently archive the process data for future reference.,To prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information.,To free up main memory temporarily for other processes or portions.,To reduce the overall CPU load by offloading data processing.,To compress the data before it is loaded back into memory for faster access.,C,"Swapping is a mechanism to temporarily move a process or a portion of it out of main memory to a backing store, making room for other processes to execute, as process instructions and data must be in memory for execution."
Which of the following is a direct consequence of implementing swapping in an operating system?,It strictly limits the total physical address space of all processes to the real physical memory size.,It always decreases the overall degree of multiprogramming.,It allows the total physical address space of all processes to exceed the real physical memory.,It mandates the use of solid-state drives exclusively for backing stores.,It eliminates the need for any form of main memory in the system.,C,"Swapping allows the combined memory requirements of all processes to be larger than the available physical memory, thus enabling more processes to run than would otherwise be possible. It also increases the degree of multiprogramming."
What defines 'standard swapping'?,The movement of only a few select pages of a process between memory and backing store.,The primary method of memory management used by contemporary mobile operating systems.,The process of moving entire processes between main memory and a backing store.,The voluntary relinquishment of memory by applications when system resources are low.,A technique primarily focused on reducing the number of write operations to flash memory.,C,Standard swapping is defined as moving entire processes between main memory and a backing store. This method is generally no longer used in contemporary OS due to the prohibitive time involved.
"In the context of process swapping, what are the characteristics of a 'backing store'?",It is the main memory (RAM) and acts as the primary storage for active processes.,"It is a slow, archival storage area used for long-term data preservation.","It is a fast secondary storage, large enough for process parts, with direct access to memory images.","It is a dedicated cache within the CPU, designed for very rapid access to small data sets.",It refers to volatile memory that loses its contents when power is off.,C,"The backing store is described as a fast secondary storage area, large enough for process parts, and allowing direct access to memory images for efficient swapping operations."
"Why is standard swapping generally no longer used in contemporary operating systems like Linux and Windows, with few exceptions?",The metadata management for swapped-out processes became overly complex.,The time required to move entire processes between memory and backing store is prohibitive.,Backing stores available today are not fast enough to support it efficiently.,"It does not allow for physical memory oversubscription, which is a key modern requirement.","It only supports single-threaded applications, making it unsuitable for modern software.",B,The text states that standard swapping is largely replaced because the time to move entire processes between memory and backing store is prohibitive for efficient operation in modern systems.
"In the context of modern operating systems, what does the term 'paging' specifically refer to?",The standard swapping mechanism that moves entire processes.,The process of terminating applications when memory is low.,"A variation of swapping where only individual pages of a process are moved, not the entire process.",The initial loading of an application's executable code into memory.,The practice of allocating memory manually by application developers.,C,"The text clarifies that 'paging' refers to 'swapping with paging,' where only a subset of pages for processes are moved to/from the backing store, not the entire process, to avoid the high cost of moving whole processes."
What is the action described as 'page out' in the context of swapping with paging?,Moving a page from the backing store to main memory.,Moving a page from main memory to the backing store.,Deleting a page from the system without saving its contents.,Writing an application's current state to flash memory on a mobile device.,Loading an executable file from disk into the main memory.,B,The term 'page out' is specifically defined as the process of moving a page from main memory to the backing store.
Which of the following is NOT a stated reason why mobile systems typically do not support swapping?,"Their use of flash memory for nonvolatile storage, leading to space constraints.",The limited number of writes that flash memory tolerates before becoming unreliable.,Poor throughput between main memory and flash memory.,"Mobile systems are designed with an abundance of physical memory, negating the need for swapping.",The need for applications to voluntarily relinquish memory.,D,"The text explicitly lists flash memory constraints (space, limited writes) and poor throughput as reasons why mobile systems typically do not support swapping. It does not state that mobile systems have an abundance of physical memory; in fact, memory is a constraint that leads to alternative strategies. Option E is an alternative strategy, not a reason for *not* supporting swapping."
"How does Apple's iOS manage memory when free memory is low, as an alternative to traditional swapping?",It automatically swaps all idle processes to a cloud storage service.,It immediately terminates all background applications without warning.,It asks applications to voluntarily relinquish allocated memory.,It dynamically increases the physical memory capacity of the device.,It permanently deletes all read-only data from the system to free up space.,C,"Apple's iOS attempts to manage low memory by asking applications to voluntarily relinquish allocated memory. Read-only data (code) may be removed and reloaded, while modified data is never removed, and applications failing to comply may be terminated."
"What unique action might Android take when terminating a process due to insufficient free memory, which is a distinction from iOS's described approach?",It always swaps the entire process to a dedicated partition on the flash memory.,It prompts the user to manually select processes to terminate.,It writes the application's 'application state' to flash memory for a quick restart.,It compresses all remaining data in main memory to create more space.,It attempts to offload process execution to a connected desktop computer.,C,"While Android also terminates processes for insufficient memory, a distinguishing feature mentioned is that it writes the 'application state' to flash memory before termination, allowing for a quicker restart of the application later."
"According to the glossary, what is 'application state'?","The current execution status (e.g., running, paused) of an application.",A measure of an application's CPU and memory utilization.,"A software construct for data storage, noted for being written to flash memory for quick restart on Android.",The version number and developer information of an application.,The graphical user interface (GUI) layout of an application.,C,"The glossary defines 'application state' as a 'Software construct for data storage,' which the text elaborates is used by Android for quick restarts by writing it to flash memory."
"Excessive swapping, regardless of its form, is often an indicator of what system condition?",The CPU is idle and waiting for more processes to run.,The system has more active processes than available physical memory.,The backing store is operating at peak efficiency.,All applications are optimally managing their memory usage.,The network connection is experiencing high latency.,B,"The text explicitly states that swapping (in any form) is often a sign that there are more active processes than available physical memory, indicating a resource bottleneck."
What are the two common approaches suggested in the text to address system performance issues caused by excessive swapping?,Increasing the size of the backing store and compressing data in memory.,Terminating some processes or acquiring more physical memory.,Migrating to a mobile operating system and disabling virtual memory.,Implementing faster flash memory and optimizing the CPU's cache.,Converting standard swapping to paging and installing a new operating system.,B,The text provides two direct solutions for system performance issues under swapping: 'Terminate some processes' or 'Get more physical memory.'
Which types of processes are generally considered good candidates for standard swapping?,Processes that are constantly performing I/O operations.,Processes that are currently executing critical system functions.,Processes that are idle or mostly idle.,Processes requiring significant CPU-intensive computations.,Processes involved in real-time data streaming.,C,The text states that 'Idle/mostly idle processes [are] good candidates for swapping' because their memory can be temporarily freed and dedicated to active processes.
"When a process or part is swapped to a backing store, what happens to its associated data structures, including per-thread data for multithreaded processes?","They are automatically recreated when the process is swapped back in, so they are not saved.",They remain in main memory while only the core process code is swapped out.,They must be written to the backing store along with the process or its part.,They are permanently deleted to ensure data integrity during swapping.,"They are encrypted and stored in a separate, secure partition of the main memory.",C,"The text specifies that 'When process/part swapped to backing store, associated data structures (including per-thread data for multithreaded processes) must be written.' The OS also maintains metadata for restoration."
