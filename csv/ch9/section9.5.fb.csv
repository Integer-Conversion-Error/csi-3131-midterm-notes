Why must process instructions and data reside in memory?,They must be in memory for execution.
"What is the primary purpose of ""swapping"" in memory management?","To temporarily move a process or a portion of a process out of memory to a backing store, and then bring it back for continued execution."
"Define the term ""backing store"".",Secondary storage area used for process swapping.
Describe the characteristics of a backing store used for standard swapping.,It is a fast secondary storage that is large enough for process parts and provides direct access to memory images.
"Define the term ""swapped"".","Moved between main memory and a backing store. Process swapped out to free main memory, then swapped back in to continue execution."
What is the key benefit of swapping regarding memory utilization?,It allows the total physical address space of all processes to exceed the real physical memory.
How does swapping impact the degree of multiprogramming?,It increases the degree of multiprogramming.
"What does ""standard swapping"" involve?",Moving entire processes between main memory and a backing store.
What data structures are written to the backing store when a process (or part) is swapped out?,"Associated data structures, including per-thread data for multithreaded processes."
What does the operating system (OS) maintain for swapped-out processes?,Metadata for their restoration.
What is an advantage of standard swapping for physical memory oversubscription?,"It allows physical memory to be oversubscribed, accommodating more processes than physical memory can hold."
Which types of processes are ideal candidates for swapping out?,Idle or mostly idle processes.
What happens to memory allocated to inactive processes when they are swapped out?,It can be dedicated to active processes.
"What is required if an inactive, swapped-out process becomes active?",It must be swapped back into memory.
"Is ""standard swapping"" commonly used in contemporary operating systems?","Generally no, except for Solaris under dire circumstances."
Why is standard swapping generally no longer used in modern OS?,The time required to move entire processes is prohibitive.
"How do most contemporary systems (e.g., Linux, Windows) perform swapping?","They use a variation where individual pages of a process are swapped, not the entire process."
What benefit does swapping with paging share with standard swapping?,It still allows physical memory oversubscription.
What is an advantage of swapping with paging over standard swapping in terms of cost?,"It does not incur the high cost of swapping entire processes, as only a small number of pages are involved."
"How is the term ""swapping"" generally interpreted in contemporary discussions?","It generally refers to ""standard swapping"" (moving entire processes)."
"What does the term ""paging"" refer to?","It refers to ""swapping with paging"" (moving individual pages)."
"Define ""page out"".",The process of moving a page from memory to a backing store.
"Define ""page in"".","The reverse process of ""page out,"" where a page is moved from a backing store into memory."
How does swapping with paging relate to virtual memory?,It works well with virtual memory.
Do mobile systems typically support swapping?,No.
List the reasons why mobile systems generally do not support swapping.,"1. They use flash memory for nonvolatile storage, which has space constraints. 2. Flash memory has a limited number of writes it tolerates before becoming unreliable. 3. There is poor throughput between main memory and flash memory."
"How does Apple's iOS manage memory when free memory is low, instead of swapping?",It asks applications to voluntarily relinquish allocated memory.
"In iOS, what type of data is removed from main memory (and reloaded from flash if needed) when memory is low?","Read-only data (e.g., code)."
"In iOS, what type of data is never removed from main memory when memory is low?","Modified data (e.g., stack)."
What is the consequence for iOS applications that fail to free memory when requested?,They may be terminated by the OS.
How does Android manage memory when free memory is low?,"It uses a strategy similar to iOS, and may terminate processes if there is insufficient free memory."
What does Android do before terminating a process due to insufficient memory?,"It writes the ""application state"" to flash memory for a quick restart."
"Define the term ""application state"".",A software construct for data storage.
What is a key responsibility for developers on mobile systems regarding memory management?,They must carefully allocate and release memory to avoid excessive use or leaks.
"What does excessive ""swapping"" (in any form) often indicate about system performance?",It is often a sign of more active processes than available physical memory.
What are two general approaches to improve system performance when excessive swapping occurs?,1. Terminate some processes. 2. Get more physical memory.
