Page number p2: 10 bits (inner). Page offset d: 12 bits (low-order).'
Which register points to the page directory for the current process in IA-32 paging?,EAX,ESP,CR0,CR3,EIP,D,The text specifies: 'CR3 register points to page directory for current process'.
"In IA-32 paging, if the `Page_Size` flag in a page directory entry is set, what is the size of the page frame and what happens to the paging process?","4 KB, and it uses a three-level paging scheme.","4 MB, and it bypasses the inner page table.","2 MB, and it triggers a memory fault.","1 GB, and it requires a TLB flush.","64 KB, and it swaps the page to disk.",B,The text states: 'If Page_Size set: page frame is 4 MB (bypasses inner page table)'.
What is the primary purpose of Page Address Extension (PAE) in IA-32 CPU hardware?,To enable 16-bit processors to run 32-bit software.,To allow 32-bit processors to access physical address space larger than 4GB.,To convert logical addresses directly to physical addresses without segmentation.,To increase the speed of the CPU clock.,To reduce the number of segment registers.,B,The glossary defines PAE as: 'Intel IA-32 CPU hardware allowing 32-bit processors to access physical address space larger than 4GB'.
