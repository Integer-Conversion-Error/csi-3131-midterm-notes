Front,Back
What were the early 16-bit Intel chips that dominated the PC landscape?,Intel 8086 (late 1970s) and 8088 (original IBM PC).
What is IA-32?,"Intel's 32-bit chip architecture, which included Pentium processors."
What architecture are current 64-bit Intel chips based on?,x86-64 architecture.
Where does Intel dominate the market versus where it does not?,"Intel dominates PC OS (Windows, Mac, Linux) but not mobile systems, where ARM architecture is successful."
What are the two major memory-management concepts in IA-32?,Segmentation and Paging.
Describe the address translation process in IA-32 architecture.,CPU generates logical addresses → segmentation unit produces linear address → paging unit generates physical address in main memory.
What is the Memory-Management Unit (MMU) in IA-32?,The segmentation and paging units combined.
What is the maximum segment size in IA-32 segmentation?,Up to 4 GB.
What is the maximum number of segments allowed per process in IA-32 segmentation?,16 K segments.
How is the logical address space divided in IA-32 segmentation?,"Into two partitions: one for up to 8 K segments private to the process, and one for up to 8 K segments shared among all processes."
What is the Local Descriptor Table (LDT) in IA-32 segmentation?,A table that holds information for segments private to a process (first partition).
What is the Global Descriptor Table (GDT) in IA-32 segmentation?,A table that holds information for segments shared among all processes (second partition).
What is a segment descriptor in IA-32 segmentation?,"An 8-byte entry in an LDT or GDT that contains detailed information about a segment (e.g., base location, limit)."
What is the format of a logical address in IA-32 segmentation?,"(selector, offset)."
What are the components of the 16-bit selector in an IA-32 logical address?,"Segment number (s), GDT or LDT indicator (g), and protection (p)."
What is the offset in an IA-32 logical address?,A 32-bit number representing the byte location within a segment.
How many segments can be addressed at once in an IA-32 machine?,"Six, using six segment registers."
How does IA-32 optimize segment descriptor access?,Six 8-byte microprogram registers (LDT/GDT cache) hold descriptors to avoid reading from memory for every reference.
What is the length of a linear address in IA-32?,32 bits long.
How is a linear address generated from a logical address in IA-32 segmentation?,A segment register points to an LDT/GDT entry; the base and limit from the segment descriptor are used. The offset is added to the base address.
What happens if an address is invalid during IA-32 segmentation's limit check?,"A memory fault occurs, trapping to the OS."
What are the possible page sizes in IA-32 paging?,4 KB or 4 MB.
What paging scheme does IA-32 use for 4-KB pages?,A two-level paging scheme.
How is a 32-bit linear address divided for 4-KB pages in IA-32 paging?,"Page number p1 (10 high-order bits), Page number p2 (10 inner bits), and Page offset d (12 low-order bits)."
What is the page directory in IA-32 paging?,"The outermost page table, referenced by the 10 high-order bits of the linear address."
What is the function of the CR3 register in IA-32 paging?,It points to the page directory for the current process.
How does the Page_Size flag in a page directory entry affect IA-32 paging?,"If set, the page frame is 4 MB, bypassing the inner page table."
How many low-order bits are used as the offset in a 4-MB page frame in IA-32 paging?,22 low-order bits.
How does IA-32 handle page tables that are not in memory?,"Page tables can be swapped to disk for efficiency; an invalid bit in the page directory entry indicates if a table is on disk, and the OS brings it into memory on demand."
What is the purpose of Page Address Extension (PAE) in IA-32?,"To allow 32-bit processors to access physical address space larger than 4 GB, addressing the 4-GB memory limitation of 32-bit architectures."
How does PAE change the paging scheme in IA-32?,It changes it from a two-level to a three-level scheme.
What are the top two bits of a linear address used for in IA-32 PAE?,They refer to the page directory pointer table.
What additional page size does PAE support?,2-MB pages.
How did PAE increase the address space capability?,"It increased page-directory and page-table entries from 32 to 64 bits, allowing the base address of page tables/frames to extend from 20 to 24 bits."
What is the total address space increased to with PAE and what is the maximum physical memory supported?,"36 bits (allowing up to 64 GB physical memory), by combining the 24-bit base address with a 12-bit offset."
What OS support is required for PAE?,"OS support is required (e.g., Linux, Mac support it; 32-bit Windows desktop is limited to 4 GB)."
What was Intel's initial 64-bit architecture and why was it not widely adopted?,"IA-64, later known as Itanium. It was not widely adopted."
Who developed the x86-64 architecture and what were its key features?,"AMD developed it, extending the existing IA-32 instruction set to support larger logical/physical address spaces and architectural advances."
"Why is ""x86-64"" the general term for current 64-bit Intel/AMD CPUs?","Because Intel adopted AMD's x86-64 architecture, and it describes a class of 64-bit CPUs running identical instruction sets."
What is the theoretical maximum address space for a 64-bit architecture?,2^64 bytes (16 quintillion / 16 exabytes).
What is the actual virtual address size used in the x86-64 architecture?,48-bit virtual address.
What page sizes does x86-64 support?,"4 KB, 2 MB, or 1 GB."
How many levels of paging hierarchy does x86-64 use?,Four levels.
What existing addressing scheme does x86-64 use for paging?,PAE (Page Address Extension).
What are the maximum virtual and physical address capabilities of x86-64?,"Supports 48-bit virtual addresses and 52-bit physical addresses (4,096 terabytes)."
