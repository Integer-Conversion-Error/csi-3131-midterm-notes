What is Intel's primary role in chip production?,Intel designs and manufactures chips.
What is ARM's primary role in chip production?,ARM only designs and licenses architectural designs to manufacturers.
Name some well-known devices that utilize ARM processors.,"Apple devices (like iPhone, iPad) and most Android devices."
"By quantity, what is the most widely used processor architecture?","ARM architecture, with over 100 billion processors produced."
What specific ARM architecture is the primary focus of study?,The 64-bit ARM v8 architecture.
What are the three translation granule sizes available in ARM v8?,"4 KB, 16 KB, and 64 KB."
What do translation granules in ARM v8 define or provide?,Different page sizes and larger contiguous memory sections called regions.
"For an ARM v8 4 KB translation granule, what are the associated page and region sizes?","Page size: 4 KB; Region sizes: 2 MB, 1 GB."

"What is the bit architecture of ARM v8, and how many bits are currently utilized?","ARM v8 is a 64-bit architecture, but only 48 bits are currently used."
"In a 4-KB granule paging structure where all four levels are used, which bits define the offset within a page?",Bits 0-11 (low-order 12 bits) refer to the offset within the 4-KB page.
"If a Level-1 table entry in ARM v8 refers to a 1-GB region, which bits are used as the offset?",Low-order 30 bits (0-29).
"If a Level-2 table entry in ARM v8 refers to a 2-MB region, which bits are used as the offset?",Low-order 21 bits (0-20).
How many levels of TLBs does the ARM architecture support?,Two levels.
What are the components of the inner level of ARM TLBs?,"Two micro TLBs (one for data, one for instructions); they support ASIDs."
What is the component of the outer level of ARM TLBs?,A single main TLB.
Where does the address translation process begin in ARM architecture?,At the micro-TLB level.
What happens during address translation if there is a micro-TLB miss?,The main TLB is checked.
What happens during address translation if both the micro-TLB and main TLB miss?,A page table walk is performed in hardware.
Define translation granules.,Features of ARM v8 CPUs defining page sizes and regions.
Define regions (in ARM v8 CPUs).,Contiguous memory areas with separate privilege and access rules.
Define translation table base register (TTBR).,ARM v8 CPU register pointing to the level 0 (outer) page table for the current thread.
Define micro TLB.,"ARM CPU inner-level TLBs, one for instructions and one for data."
Define main TLB.,ARM CPU outer-level TLB; checked after micro TLB lookup and before page table walk.
