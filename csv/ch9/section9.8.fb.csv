What is memory in modern computer systems?,"A large array of bytes, each with its own address."
How is address space allocation managed?,Using base and limit registers.
What is a Base register?,The smallest legal physical memory address.
What does 'Limit' specify in address space allocation?,The size of the address range.
What are the different times for binding symbolic address references to physical addresses?,"Compile time, Load time, Execution time."
What is a Logical address?,An address generated by the CPU.
What is an MMU (Memory Management Unit)?,A hardware component that translates a logical address to a physical address.
What is a Physical address?,"The actual address in physical memory, resulting from an MMU translation of a logical address."
Describe a common memory allocation approach.,Contiguous memory partitions of varying sizes.
What are the three common partition allocation strategies?,"First fit, Best fit, Worst fit."
Which memory management technique do modern OS typically use?,Paging.
How is Physical memory divided in paging?,Into fixed-sized blocks called frames.
What are Frames in the context of paging?,Fixed-sized blocks into which physical memory is divided.
How is Logical memory divided in paging?,Into blocks of the same size called pages.
What are Pages in the context of paging?,Blocks of the same size into which logical memory is divided.
How is a logical address divided in paging?,Into a page number and a page offset.
What is a Page number?,An index into a per-process page table.
What is a Page table?,A data structure that contains the frame in physical memory holding a specific page.
What is the Offset in paging?,The specific location within a frame.
What is a TLB (Translation Look-aside Buffer)?,A hardware cache of the page table.
What information does each TLB entry contain?,A page number and its corresponding frame.
Describe the steps of TLB in address translation.,"1. Get the page number from the logical address. 2. Check if the frame for the page is in the TLB. 3. If in TLB, the frame is obtained from TLB. 4. If not in TLB (TLB miss), retrieve the frame from the page table."
What is Hierarchical paging?,A method where the logical address is divided into multiple parts for different page table levels.
What problem arises with expanding addresses beyond 32 bits when using hierarchical paging?,A large number of hierarchical levels would be required.
What strategies are used to address the problem of a large number of hierarchical levels in paging?,Hashed page tables and Inverted page tables.
What is Swapping?,The process of moving pages to disk to increase the degree of multiprogramming.
"How many levels of page tables does the Intel 32-bit architecture typically use, and what page sizes does it support?","Two levels of page tables, supporting 4-KB or 4-MB page sizes."
What is Page-address extension (PAE)?,A feature that allows 32-bit processors to access a physical address space greater than 4 GB.
Which modern architectures use hierarchical paging for their 64-bit systems?,x86-64 and ARM v8 architectures.
