What is a key characteristic of memory in modern computer systems?,"It is central to modern computer systems and is a large array of bytes, each with its own address.",y
What mechanism is used for address space allocation?,Base and limit registers.,y
"Define ""Base register"".",The smallest legal physical memory address.,y
"What does ""Limit"" specify in the context of memory address allocation?",The size of the address range.,y
List the different times at which symbolic address references can be bound to physical addresses.,"Compile time, Load time, Execution time.",y
"What is a ""Logical address"" and by what is it generated?",An address generated by the CPU.,y
What is the purpose of the Memory Management Unit (MMU)?,It translates a logical address to a physical address.,y
"Define ""Memory Management Unit (MMU)"".",A hardware component that translates logical addresses to physical addresses.,y
What kind of address does the MMU output?,Physical address.,y
Describe a common memory allocation approach for contiguous memory.,Using contiguous memory partitions of varying sizes.,y
Name the common partition allocation strategies.,"First fit, Best fit, Worst fit.",y
"What are ""First fit"", ""Best fit"", and ""Worst fit""?",Common strategies for allocating memory partitions.,y
How do modern operating systems typically manage memory?,They use paging.,y
How is physical memory divided in systems using paging?,Into fixed-sized blocks called frames.,y
"Define ""Frames"" in the context of memory management.",Fixed-sized blocks into which physical memory is divided in systems using paging.,y
How is logical memory divided in systems using paging?,Into blocks of the same size called pages.,y
"Define ""Pages"" in the context of memory management.","Fixed-sized blocks into which logical memory is divided in systems using paging, where each block is the same size as a frame.",y
How is a logical address structured in a paging system?,It is divided into a page number and a page offset.,y
"What is the ""Page number"" used for in paging?",It serves as an index into a per-process page table.,y
"What information does a ""Page table"" contain?",It contains the frame in physical memory that holds the corresponding page.,y
"Define ""Page table"".","A data structure, typically per-process, that maps logical page numbers to physical frames.",y
"What does the ""Offset"" represent in a logical address in paging?",It represents the specific location within a frame.,y
"Define ""Translation Look-aside Buffer (TLB)"".",A hardware cache of the page table.,y
What is the purpose of a TLB?,To speed up address translation by caching frequently accessed page table entries.,y
What information does each entry in a TLB contain?,A page number and its corresponding frame.,y
Describe the process of address translation using a TLB.,1. Get the page number from the logical address. 2. Check if the frame for the page is in the TLB. 3. If in TLB: frame obtained from TLB (TLB hit). 4. If not in TLB: retrieve from page table (TLB miss).,y
"Define ""Hierarchical paging"".",A memory management technique where the logical address is divided into multiple parts for different page table levels.,y
What problem arises with hierarchical paging when expanding addresses beyond 32 bits?,"It leads to a large number of hierarchical levels, increasing overhead.",y
What strategies are used to address the problem of many hierarchical levels with expanding addresses?,Hashed page tables and Inverted page tables.,y
"Define ""Swapping"".",The process of moving pages from physical memory to disk to increase the degree of multiprogramming.,y
What is the purpose of swapping?,To increase the degree of multiprogramming by moving less active pages to disk.,y
Describe the paging characteristics of Intel's 32-bit architecture.,It uses two levels of page tables and supports 4-KB or 4-MB page sizes.,y
"What is ""Page-address extension"" (PAE)?",A feature that allows 32-bit processors to access a physical address space greater than 4 GB.,y
What memory management technique do x86-64 and ARM v8 architectures use?,They are 64-bit architectures that use hierarchical paging.,y
