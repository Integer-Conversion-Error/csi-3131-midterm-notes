What memory management technique is memory compression primarily presented as an alternative to?,Paging,Swapping to disk,Virtualization,Cache management,Process scheduling,A,The text explicitly states: 'Alternative to paging: memory compression.'
What is the fundamental mechanism by which memory compression reduces memory usage?,It deallocates unused memory regions.,It increases the size of individual memory frames.,It consolidates the contents of several frames into a single frame.,It moves less frequently used data to a faster storage device.,It encrypts memory contents to reduce their footprint.,C,The text describes memory compression as the process to 'Compress several frames into a single frame.'
What is a key advantage of memory compression over traditional memory management techniques?,It eliminates the need for any form of memory management.,It increases the physical RAM capacity of a system.,It reduces memory usage without requiring pages to be swapped to disk.,It allows direct execution of programs from compressed files.,It provides a faster way to access data stored on secondary storage.,C,The text highlights that memory compression 'Reduces memory usage without swapping pages.'
"According to the example provided, what condition typically initiates the page replacement process that can lead to memory compression?",When the CPU utilization exceeds a certain threshold.,When the free-frame list goes above a predefined limit.,When the free-frame list falls below a specific threshold.,When an application requests more memory than is physically available.,When the system detects a memory leak in a running process.,C,The text states: 'Free-frame list below threshold -> triggers page replacement.'
"During the memory compression process, what happens to selected frames (e.g., 15, 3, 35) after they are identified for replacement, instead of writing them to swap space?",They are immediately discarded to free up space.,They are moved to a high-priority queue for immediate processing.,They are encrypted and then stored in a secure memory region.,They are compressed and stored together into a single page frame.,They are decompressed and spread across multiple available frames.,D,"The text specifies: 'Instead of writing to swap space, compress frames (e.g., three) into single page frame.'"
"In the memory compression example (Figure 10.7.2), what is the first action taken with the target frame (e.g., Frame 7) that will store the compressed data?",It is immediately written to swap space.,It is moved to the list of compressed frames.,It is removed from the free-frame list.,It is marked as read-only to prevent accidental overwrites.,It is filled with placeholder data to prepare for compression.,C,The text describes the process starting with: 'Frame 7 removed from free-frame list.'
"Following the compression of multiple frames (e.g., 15, 3, 35) into a single frame (e.g., Frame 7), what happens to the original individual frames (15, 3, 35)?",They are immediately swapped out to disk.,They are marked as unavailable for future use.,"They are moved to the free-frame list, becoming available for other uses.",They remain allocated to the original process until it terminates.,They are deleted from memory entirely.,C,"The text states: 'Frames 15, 3, 35 moved to free-frame list.'"
What is the system's response if a program attempts to reference a page that has been compressed and stored within a consolidated frame?,The system issues a warning and prevents access.,The compressed data is directly accessed without modification.,"A page fault occurs, leading to the decompression and restoration of the original pages.",The system automatically swaps the compressed frame to disk.,The reference is redirected to an alternative memory location.,C,"The text clearly states: 'If compressed frame referenced -> page fault, decompressed, restoring original pages.'"
How do mobile operating systems like Android and iOS generally handle standard swapping and paging mechanisms?,They rely heavily on standard swapping and paging.,They implement a significantly modified version of traditional swapping.,They do not generally support standard swapping/paging.,They use swapping and paging exclusively for critical system processes.,They offload all paging operations to a dedicated hardware component.,C,"The text specifies: 'Mobile systems (Android, iOS) generally don't support standard swapping/paging.'"
"Given the general lack of standard swapping/paging in mobile systems, what is the role of memory compression in their memory-management strategy?",It is a supplementary feature activated only under extreme memory pressure.,It is an experimental feature not widely adopted.,It is an integral component of their memory-management strategy.,It is an optional tool for developers to optimize app performance.,"It is primarily used for long-term data storage, not active memory management.",C,The text notes: 'Memory compression integral to their memory-management strategy.'

"On Windows 10, which specific type of applications running on mobile devices are identified as candidates for memory compression?",Traditional Win32 applications,Command-line interface (CLI) tools,Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps,Legacy .NET Framework applications,Games designed with DirectX 9,C,The text specifies: 'Windows 10: Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps on mobile devices are candidates.'
"How does macOS (Version 10.9+) manage memory when free memory becomes short, regarding compression and paging?",It immediately pages all memory contents to disk.,"It first compresses frequently used pages, then pages the least recently used.","It compresses LRU (Least Recently Used) pages, and only then pages them if necessary.",It prioritizes paging critical system processes before considering compression.,It expands compressed data to free up space before resorting to paging.,C,"The text details: 'macOS (Version 10.9+): compresses LRU pages when free memory is short, then pages if needed.'"
"Based on performance tests on macOS, how does memory compression compare to paging to an SSD?",Paging to SSD is significantly faster.,Both methods exhibit similar performance characteristics.,Memory compression is faster than paging to SSD.,Memory compression often leads to system crashes on SSDs.,Paging to SSD is more power-efficient.,C,The text states: 'Performance tests: memory compression faster than paging to SSD on macOS.'
What is a necessary resource allocation requirement for memory compression to function?,It requires a large amount of dedicated swap space on the hard drive.,It requires a specialized hardware module for decompression.,It requires allocating free frames to store the compressed pages.,It requires a high-speed network connection for cloud-based storage.,It requires exclusive access to the CPU's L1 cache.,C,The text states: 'Memory compression requires allocating free frames for compressed pages.'
What is an example of the significant memory saving possible with memory compression as mentioned in the text?,Reducing 5 frames to 2,Reducing 4 frames to 2,Reducing 3 frames to 1,Reducing 2 frames to 1,Reducing 10 frames to 5,C,"The text provides an example: 'Significant memory saving possible (e.g., 3 frames to 1).'"
