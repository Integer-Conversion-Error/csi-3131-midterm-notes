What is the primary purpose of I/O scheduling in an operating system?,To allow applications to directly control device hardware,To determine a good execution order for I/O requests,To minimize the number of I/O requests,To guarantee immediate execution of all I/O system calls,To prevent any form of I/O buffering,B,"I/O scheduling determines an efficient execution order for I/O requests, which is often different from the application's system call order."
Which of the following is NOT a benefit of I/O scheduling?,Improved overall system performance,Reduced average waiting time,Fair device access,Guaranteed sequential execution of application I/O calls,Increased computer efficiency,D,"I/O scheduling often reorders requests for efficiency, meaning the sequential order of application I/O calls is rarely maintained if it's not optimal."
How does the operating system typically implement I/O scheduling for a device?,By giving direct control of the device to the requesting application,By immediately executing every I/O system call in the order it arrives,By maintaining a wait queue for each device and rearranging requests,By relying solely on hardware to order requests,By converting all I/O requests into network packets,C,I/O schedulers maintain a wait queue for each device and rearrange the requests within that queue for efficiency.

"Beyond scheduling I/O operations, how else does the kernel I/O subsystem improve computer efficiency, especially concerning storage space?",By directly writing all data to permanent storage without temporary copies,By eliminating the need for main memory,"By using storage space in main memory/storage hierarchy via buffering, caching, and spooling",By compressing all data transfers on the fly without dedicated buffers,By restricting the number of concurrent I/O requests,C,"The text states that the I/O subsystem 'Also uses storage space in main memory/storage hierarchy via buffering, caching, spooling' to improve efficiency."
What is a `buffer` in the context of I/O?,A region of fast memory holding copies of data for performance improvement,A memory area specifically for CPU instruction caching,A memory area storing data being transferred between devices or between a device and an application,A file on secondary storage used for temporary output,A process control block,C,A buffer is defined as a memory area storing data transferred between devices or between a device and an application.
One primary reason for using buffering in the kernel's I/O subsystem is to:,Increase the CPU's clock speed,Cope with speed mismatches between producer and consumer devices,Reduce the total amount of data transferred,Directly execute privileged I/O instructions from user space,Eliminate the need for device drivers,B,"Buffering helps to manage differences in data transfer rates between a producer (e.g., slow network) and a consumer (e.g., fast SSD), allowing data to accumulate before being written in larger chunks."
What is the main advantage of `double buffering`?,It reduces the total memory required for I/O operations,It eliminates the need for any data copying,It allows producers and consumers to be decoupled and relax their timing constraints,It ensures data is always written to disk immediately,It prevents all types of I/O errors,C,"Double buffering uses two buffers, allowing one to be filled by the producer while the other is being emptied by the consumer, thereby decoupling their timing and improving efficiency."
"Besides coping with speed mismatches, what other reason is cited for using buffering?",To encrypt all data transfers,To enforce strict real-time deadlines,To provide adaptations for different data-transfer sizes,To perform file system defragmentation,To allow direct memory access for user applications,C,"Buffering also helps adapt to different data-transfer sizes, such as managing network fragmentation and reassembly."
