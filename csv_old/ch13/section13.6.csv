Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
"According to the text, how is a file primarily defined in the context of an operating system?",A physical block on a storage device,A sequence of physical records,"An abstract data type, sequence of logical records",A directory entry pointing to an inode,A program's executable code loaded into memory,C,"The text defines a file as an 'abstract data type, sequence of logical records'."
Which of the following are explicitly mentioned as examples of logical record types a file can consist of?,"CPU registers, cache lines, memory pages","Network packets, protocol headers, routing tables","Byte, line, or complex data","Interrupt vectors, system calls, process IDs","Disk sectors, disk blocks, cylinder groups",C,"The text states that logical records can be 'byte, line, complex data'."
What is a primary task of the Operating System concerning the file concept?,To design new file formats for applications,To manage network connectivity for remote files,To map the logical file concept to physical storage,To automatically compress all files to save space,To provide a graphical user interface for file management,C,The text identifies 'OS task: map logical file concept to physical storage' as a key responsibility.
The Operating System's role in file management may include ordering logical records into which of the following?,Virtual memory pages,Network buffers,User-defined data structures,Physical records,Application program interfaces (APIs),D,The text states that the OS 'May order logical records into physical records'.
What is the fundamental purpose of directories in a file system?,To execute applications directly,To store backup copies of files,To organize files,To manage user authentication,To control network access permissions,C,"The text explicitly states, 'Directories: organize files'."
"What is a significant drawback of a single-level directory system, especially in multiuser environments?",Limited storage capacity for files,Slow file access times,Naming problems requiring unique names for all files,Inability to support various file types,High overhead for directory operations,C,The text notes 'Single-level directory: naming problems in multiuser systems (unique names required)'.
How does a two-level directory system solve the naming problems encountered in single-level directories?,By allowing duplicate file names within the same directory,By assigning a separate directory for each user,By using numerical identifiers instead of names for files,By limiting the total number of files in the system,By requiring all file names to be encrypted,B,"The text explains, 'Two-level directory: separate directory for each user, solves naming problems'."
Which of the following attributes are listed as being typically found in a two-level directory entry?,"Processor type, memory size, operating system version","Network address, MAC address, connection status","File name, location, length, type, owner, times","Application license key, installation date, developer name","Hardware serial number, warranty expiration, service history",C,"The text states that a two-level directory 'Lists file name, location, length, type, owner, times'."
A tree-structured directory is described as a generalization of which other directory organization?,Single-level directory,Acyclic-graph directory,General graph structure,Two-level directory,Flat directory,D,"The text specifies, 'Tree-structured directory: generalization of two-level'."
What key organizational feature is enabled by a tree-structured directory?,Complete flexibility in sharing files without restrictions,Simplification of all file deletion processes,The allowance for subdirectories to organize files hierarchically,The automatic resolution of all naming conflicts,The ability to integrate remote file systems seamlessly,C,The text states that a tree-structured directory 'allows subdirectories for organization'.
What is a characteristic advantage of an acyclic-graph directory structure?,It strictly prevents any form of file sharing.,It simplifies the process of searching and deletion.,It allows sharing of subdirectories/files.,"It mandates a single, central directory for all users.",It eliminates the need for any form of file protection.,C,"The text notes, 'Acyclic-graph directory: allows sharing of subdirectories/files'."
"Despite its advantages, what operations does an acyclic-graph directory complicate?",File creation and modification,Directory creation and renaming,Mounting and unmounting of file systems,Searching and deletion,Changing file ownership and permissions,D,"The text explicitly states, 'Acyclic-graph directory... complicates searching/deletion'."
Which directory structure offers complete flexibility in sharing files and subdirectories?,Single-level directory,Two-level directory,Tree-structured directory,Acyclic-graph directory,General graph structure,E,The text describes 'General graph structure: complete flexibility in sharing'.
What potential maintenance requirement is associated with a general graph structure directory due to its high flexibility in sharing?,Regular manual indexing of all files,Mandatory data defragmentation,The need for garbage collection for unused space,Frequent reinstallation of the operating system,Constant manual auditing of file permissions,C,The text mentions that a general graph structure 'may require garbage collection for unused space'.
What are the three main challenges identified for remote file systems?,"Cost, complexity, and compatibility","Reliability, performance, and security","Scalability, portability, and maintainability","Bandwidth, latency, and throughput","Encryption, compression, and deduplication",B,"The text explicitly lists 'challenges in reliability, performance, security' for remote file systems."
"In the context of remote file systems, what kind of information do distributed information systems manage for shared state?",Network hardware specifications,Application source code and binaries,"User, host, and access information",Database schema definitions,Printer queue status and job logs,C,"The text states, 'Distributed information systems manage user, host, access info for shared state'."
File protection is primarily required in which type of system environment?,"Single-user, offline systems",Systems with limited storage capacity,Multiuser systems,Embedded systems without network access,Systems with only read-only files,C,"The text states, 'File protection: needed on multiuser systems'."
Which of the following are listed as specific types of access controlled by file protection?,"Copy, paste, cut, rename, print","Login, logout, suspend, hibernate","Read, write, execute, append, delete, list directory","Install, uninstall, update, roll back","Compress, encrypt, decrypt, decompress",C,"The text lists 'read, write, execute, append, delete, list directory' as controlled access types."
What methods are explicitly mentioned for providing file protection?,Firewalls and antivirus software,Data encryption and digital signatures,"Access lists, passwords, and other techniques",Backup and recovery procedures,Network segmentation and intrusion detection systems,C,"The text specifies 'Protection via access lists, passwords, other techniques'."
