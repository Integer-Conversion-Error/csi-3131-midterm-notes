What common synchronization tools are specifically mentioned as frequent sources of deadlock?,Timers and event handlers.,Mutex locks and semaphores.,Message queues and pipes.,Sockets and network connections.,Shared memory segments and file descriptors.,B,The text states under 'Synchronization Tools as Resources': 'Mutex locks and semaphores are common sources of deadlock.'
How are individual lock instances typically categorized within the system model's resource types?,They are all considered part of a single generic 'lock' resource type.,Each lock instance is typically its own distinct resource class.,Locks are not considered resources in this model.,They are grouped into resource types based on the data they protect.,"Locks are only managed by user applications, not the system.",B,"The text specifies, 'Each lock instance is typically its own resource class (e.g., one lock for a queue, another for a linked list).'"
What is the correct sequence of resource utilization by a thread as outlined in the system model?,"Use, Request, Release.","Release, Use, Request.","Request, Use, Release.","Acquire, Operate, Free.","Allocate, Consume, Discard.",C,"The 'Resource Utilization Sequence' is listed as: '1. Request, 2. Use, 3. Release.'"
"In the 'Request' phase of resource utilization, what happens if the requested resource is not immediately available?",The thread aborts its execution.,The thread proceeds without the resource.,The thread enters a waiting state.,The system grants a partial resource.,The resource is automatically destroyed.,C,"Under the 'Request' phase, the text says: 'Thread requests a resource. Waits if not immediately available.'"
"Which of the following are listed as ways a thread can initiate resource requests and releases, excluding synchronization operations?",Sending email notifications.,"System calls like `request()`, `release()`, `open()`, `close()`, `allocate()`, `free()`.",Hardware interrupts.,Direct memory access to resource tables.,Network packets to other systems.,B,"The text states, 'Request/release can be system calls (request(), release(), open(), close(), allocate(), free()).'"
"Besides system calls, what specific semaphore and mutex lock operations are mentioned for managing resource acquisition and release?",`print()` and `scan()`.,`start()` and `stop()`.,"`wait()` and `signal()` for semaphores, and `acquire()` and `release()` for mutex locks.",`read()` and `write()`.,`create()` and `destroy()`.,C,"The text lists 'semaphore operations (wait(), signal()) and mutex locks (acquire(), release()).'"
How does the operating system typically check for resource allocation?,By querying individual threads directly.,By consulting a network database.,Via a system table.,By random guesswork.,By physically inspecting hardware components.,C,"The text states, 'OS checks for resource allocation via a system table.'"
What information does the OS's system table track regarding resources?,User login times and system uptime.,Free/allocated resources and the owning thread.,Network bandwidth usage and data transfer rates.,Application error logs and debugger information.,CPU clock speed and temperature.,B,"The text specifies, 'Table tracks free/allocated resources and the owning thread.'"
"When resources are unavailable and threads enter a waiting state, where are these waiting threads typically placed?",They are terminated immediately by the OS.,They are sent to a separate server for processing.,They are queued for requested resources.,They are put into a dormant state indefinitely.,"They are given alternative, non-resource-dependent tasks.",C,"The text mentions, 'Waiting threads are queued for requested resources.'"
Which statement accurately defines a deadlocked state specifically concerning a set of threads?,Every thread in a set is actively executing without interruption.,Every thread in a set is waiting for an event that can only be caused by another thread in the set.,Threads are competing for an infinite number of resources.,A single thread holds all system resources.,Threads are synchronized to complete tasks simultaneously.,B,The text describes a 'Deadlocked State' as: 'Every thread in a set is waiting for an event that can only be caused by another thread in the set.'
"What are the primary events that threads typically wait for in a deadlocked state, as highlighted in the text?",User input and output operations.,Network communication and data transfer.,Resource acquisition and release.,System reboots and shutdown commands.,Code compilation and debugging processes.,C,The text identifies the 'Main events' for which threads wait in a deadlocked state as 'resource acquisition and release.'
"Which classic problem is given as an example to illustrate a deadlocked state, specifically involving a circular wait?",The Producer-Consumer Problem.,The Reader-Writer Problem.,The Dining-Philosophers Problem.,The Sleeping Barber Problem.,The Bounded-Buffer Problem.,C,"The text explicitly mentions, 'Example: Dining-philosophers problem. Each philosopher holds one chopstick and waits for another, creating a circular wait.'"
What is a key responsibility highlighted for developers concerning deadlocks?,"To ignore deadlock possibilities, as they are handled by the OS.",To be aware of deadlock possibilities.,To ensure infinite resources are available to prevent deadlocks.,To write only single-threaded applications to avoid deadlocks entirely.,To rely solely on the operating system for automatic deadlock resolution.,B,The text states under 'Developer Responsibility': 'Must be aware of deadlock possibilities.'
"What is the relationship between locking tools, race conditions, and deadlocks as described for developers?",Locking tools prevent deadlocks and cause race conditions.,Locking tools prevent race conditions and automatically avoid deadlocks.,Locking tools prevent race conditions but require careful management of lock acquisition/release to avoid deadlocks.,Locking tools cause both race conditions and deadlocks.,Locking tools are irrelevant to race conditions or deadlocks.,C,"The text explains, 'Locking tools prevent race conditions but require careful management of lock acquisition/release to avoid deadlocks.'"
"According to the Section Glossary, what is the definition of 'deadlock'?",A state where processes are constantly running without interruption.,The state in which two processes or threads are stuck waiting for an event that can only be caused by one of the processes or threads.,A situation where resources are abundant and freely available to all processes.,A condition where processes communicate directly without shared resources.,The successful completion of all process tasks in parallel.,B,The 'Section glossary' defines 'deadlock' as 'The state in which two processes or threads are stuck waiting for an event that can only be caused by one of the processes or threads.'
