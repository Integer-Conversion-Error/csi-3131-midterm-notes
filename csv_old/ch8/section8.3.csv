Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
Which of the following conditions is NOT one of the four necessary conditions for a deadlock situation to arise?,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Resource sharing,Circular wait,D,"The four necessary conditions for deadlock are Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, and Circular wait. Resource sharing is the opposite of Mutual exclusion in this context, where resources are nonsharable."
"For a deadlock situation to occur, what is the critical requirement regarding the four necessary conditions?",At least two conditions must hold simultaneously.,Only the Circular wait condition is strictly necessary.,All four conditions must hold simultaneously.,The conditions must occur sequentially.,Any one of the four conditions is sufficient for a deadlock.,C,The text states: 'All four conditions must hold simultaneously in a system' for a deadlock situation to arise.
"In the context of deadlock characterization, what does the 'Mutual exclusion' condition imply about resources?",All resources must be sharable among threads.,"Resources can be shared, but only one thread can access them at a time.",At least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode.,Resources can be preempted from threads.,Resources must be released voluntarily by threads.,C,The definition of Mutual exclusion is: 'At least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode.'
"If all resources in a system are designed to be freely sharable among multiple threads, which necessary condition for deadlock is most likely violated?",Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Mutual exclusion,Resource allocation,D,"Mutual exclusion requires that 'at least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode'. If all resources are freely sharable, this condition cannot be met."
Which statement accurately describes the 'Hold and wait' condition for a deadlock?,A thread releases all its resources before requesting new ones.,A thread is waiting for resources but holds none.,A thread must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.,A thread requests resources that are immediately available.,A thread holds resources indefinitely without releasing them.,C,The definition of Hold and wait is: 'A thread must be holding at least one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources held by other threads.'
"Consider a scenario where a thread, T1, currently holds Resource A and is requesting Resource B, which is held by Thread T2. This scenario directly illustrates which necessary condition for deadlock?",No preemption,Mutual exclusion,Circular wait,Hold and wait,Resource sharing,D,This scenario perfectly matches the definition of Hold and wait: 'A thread must be holding at least one resource (Resource A) and waiting to acquire additional resources (Resource B) held by other threads (T2).'
The 'No preemption' condition for deadlock specifies what about resource release?,Resources can be forcibly taken from a thread.,Resources are automatically released after a fixed time.,A resource can be released only voluntarily by the thread holding it.,Resources are released upon system shutdown.,Threads can only release all resources simultaneously.,C,No preemption states: 'A resource can be released only voluntarily by the thread holding it.'
"If an operating system allows resources to be forcibly taken away from a thread (e.g., CPU time slice), which deadlock condition is being violated?",Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Resource availability,C,"No preemption explicitly states that 'A resource can be released only voluntarily by the thread holding it.' If resources can be forcibly taken, this condition is violated."
Which of the following describes the 'Circular wait' condition for deadlock?,A thread is waiting for any resource to become available.,"A set of waiting threads exists where each thread is waiting for a resource held by the next thread in the set, and the last thread is waiting for a resource held by the first.",All threads are waiting for the same resource simultaneously.,Threads release resources in a specific order to avoid cycles.,A thread is waiting for multiple instances of the same resource type.,B,"Circular wait is defined as: 'A set of waiting threads $\{T_0, T_1, \dots, T_n\}$ must exist such that $T_0$ is waiting for a resource held by $T_1$, $T_1$ is waiting for a resource held by $T_2$, \dots, $T_{n-1}$ is waiting for a resource held by $T_n$, and $T_n$ is waiting for a resource held by $T_0$.'"
The text states that 'The circular-wait condition implies the hold-and-wait condition'. What does this mean for deadlock prevention?,"If you prevent Hold and Wait, you automatically prevent Circular Wait.",Circular Wait is a weaker condition than Hold and Wait.,"If Circular Wait is present, Hold and Wait must also be present.",These two conditions are mutually exclusive.,Preventing Circular Wait has no impact on Hold and Wait.,C,"If A implies B, then whenever A is true, B must also be true. So, if Circular Wait exists (is true), then Hold and Wait must also exist (be true)."
What type of graph is used for a precise description of deadlocks?,Flow chart,Gantt chart,State transition graph,System resource-allocation graph,Dependency graph,D,The text explicitly states: 'Deadlocks can be described using a directed graph called a system resource-allocation graph.'
A system resource-allocation graph consists of which two main components?,Threads and processes,Vertices and edges,Resources and instances,Requests and assignments,Cycles and paths,B,The graph consists of 'a set of vertices V and a set of edges E'.
"In a system resource-allocation graph, what do the vertices partitioned as 'R' represent?",Active threads,Resource types,Request edges,Assignment edges,Deadlocked processes,B,"Vertices V are partitioned into two types: 'T = {...}, the set of all active threads.' and 'R = {...}, the set of all resource types.'"
"In a system resource-allocation graph, what does a directed edge from thread $T_i$ to resource type $R_j$ ($T_i ightarrow R_j$) signify?",An instance of $R_j$ has been allocated to $T_i$.,$T_i$ has released an instance of $R_j$.,$T_i$ has requested an instance of $R_j$.,$R_j$ is held exclusively by $T_i$.,$R_j$ is waiting for $T_i$.,C,"A directed edge from thread $T_i$ to resource type $R_j$ ($T_i ightarrow R_j$) is a request edge; 'it signifies that $T_i$ has requested an instance of $R_j$.'"
"What type of edge is represented by an arrow pointing from a resource type $R_j$ to a thread $T_i$ ($R_j ightarrow T_i$) in a system resource-allocation graph?",Request edge,Waiting edge,Assignment edge,Dependency edge,Cycle edge,C,"A directed edge from resource type $R_j$ to thread $T_i$ ($R_j ightarrow T_i$) is an assignment edge."
"If a system resource-allocation graph contains no cycles, what can be definitively concluded?",A deadlock situation is imminent.,All resources are sharable.,No thread is deadlocked.,All threads are waiting for resources.,The system is experiencing high contention.,C,"The text states: 'If the graph contains no cycles, no thread is deadlocked.'"
"When a system resource-allocation graph contains a cycle, what is the immediate implication?",A deadlock has definitely occurred.,No deadlock can occur.,A deadlock may exist.,All resources are free.,The system is perfectly balanced.,C,"The text states: 'If the graph contains a cycle, a deadlock may exist.' It's not a definite conclusion unless specific conditions about resource instances are met."
Under what specific condition does a cycle in a system resource-allocation graph definitively imply a deadlock has occurred?,If each resource type has several instances.,If no thread is waiting for a resource.,If each resource type has exactly one instance.,If all resources are currently available.,If only request edges form the cycle.,C,"The text specifies: 'If each resource type has exactly one instance, a cycle implies a deadlock has occurred.'"
"If a system resource-allocation graph has a cycle, and each resource type has several instances, what is the status of the cycle regarding deadlock?",The cycle guarantees a deadlock.,The cycle indicates no possibility of deadlock.,The cycle is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for deadlock.,The cycle is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for deadlock.,The cycle is irrelevant to deadlock detection.,C,"The text states: 'If each resource type has several instances, a cycle is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for deadlock.'"
"According to the glossary, what is the primary function of a 'system resource-allocation graph'?",To visualize thread execution paths.,To manage memory allocation.,To provide a precise description of deadlocks.,To track CPU utilization.,To optimize resource access times.,C,The glossary defines 'system resource-allocation graph' as 'A directed graph for precise description of deadlocks.'
What does a 'request edge' in a system resource-allocation graph indicate?,A resource has been assigned to a thread.,A resource is being released by a thread.,A thread is waiting for another thread.,An edge (arrow) indicating a resource request.,A deadlock has occurred.,D,"The glossary defines 'request edge' as 'In a system resource-allocation graph, an edge (arrow) indicating a resource request.'"
What does an 'assignment edge' in a system resource-allocation graph indicate?,A thread is requesting a resource.,A resource is available.,An edge (arrow) indicating a resource assignment.,A resource is in a waiting state.,A thread has completed its execution.,C,"The glossary defines 'assignment edge' as 'In a system resource-allocation graph, an edge (arrow) indicating a resource assignment.'"
Which of the following scenarios would directly prevent the 'Mutual exclusion' condition from contributing to a deadlock?,Threads are designed to release all held resources before requesting new ones.,All resources in the system are sharable and can be accessed concurrently by multiple threads.,The operating system forcibly preempts resources from threads that are holding them for too long.,Resource requests are granted only if they do not create a circular wait condition.,Threads only request resources when they know they can acquire them instantly.,B,"Mutual exclusion requires 'At least one resource must be held in a nonsharable mode.' If all resources are sharable, this condition cannot hold."
"To avoid the 'Hold and wait' condition, a system might implement a policy where:",Resources are never released voluntarily.,"All required resources must be requested and allocated at once, or not at all.","Resources are granted based on their type, not availability.",Threads can only hold one resource at a time.,Threads must wait for an indefinite period before requesting resources.,B,The 'Hold and wait' condition means a thread holds some resources while waiting for others. Requiring all resources to be requested and allocated at once ensures a thread doesn't hold some while waiting for others.
A system that allows the operating system to reclaim a resource from a thread before the thread voluntarily releases it is effectively addressing which deadlock condition?,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Resource scarcity,C,"The 'No preemption' condition states 'A resource can be released only voluntarily by the thread holding it.' If the OS can reclaim resources, preemption is allowed, thus violating 'No preemption'."
Which of the following best represents the partition of vertices 'T' in a system resource-allocation graph?,The set of all available resource instances.,The set of all blocked threads.,The set of all active threads.,The set of all system calls.,The set of all resource types.,C,"The text states: 'Vertices V are partitioned into two types: T = {$T_1, T_2, \dots, T_n$}, the set of all active threads.'"
"Consider a system where Thread A requests Resource X, which is held by Thread B. Thread B requests Resource Y, which is held by Thread C. Thread C requests Resource Z, which is held by Thread A. This specific pattern exemplifies which necessary condition for deadlock?",Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Resource abundance,D,"This is a classic example of circular wait, where a set of threads ($T_A, T_B, T_C$) are waiting for resources held by each other in a cycle ($T_A ightarrow T_B ightarrow T_C ightarrow T_A$)."
