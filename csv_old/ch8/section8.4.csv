Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
Which of the following lists represents the three primary ways to deal with deadlocks as described in the text?,"Ignore, Isolate, Restore","Prevent, Detect, Resolve","Ignore problem, Prevent/Avoid, Detect/Recover","Monitor, Predict, Correct","Avoid, Mitigate, Reset",C,"The text explicitly states the three ways to deal with deadlock are 'Ignore problem', 'Prevent/Avoid', and 'Detect/Recover'."
Which operating systems are cited as examples of those that commonly employ the 'ignore problem' approach to deadlocks?,Unix and macOS,Windows and Android,Linux and Windows,iOS and Linux,macOS and Android,C,"The text mentions 'most OS, e.g., Linux, Windows' use the 'ignore problem' approach."
"According to the text, what is the main reason the 'ignore problem' solution is common for handling deadlocks?",It guarantees system stability and high performance.,It is the most robust and secure method available.,"Deadlocks occur infrequently, and other methods are costly.",It allows for immediate automatic recovery from any deadlock.,It is a proactive method that prevents deadlocks from forming.,C,The text states this solution is common 'due to infrequency of deadlocks and cost of other methods'.
What is the explicit goal of the 'Prevent/Avoid' method for handling deadlocks?,To minimize the time a system spends in a deadlocked state.,To ensure the system NEVER enters a deadlocked state.,To quickly detect and recover from deadlocks once they occur.,To allow deadlocks but provide a way for manual intervention.,To reallocate resources to break existing deadlocks.,B,The text states 'Prevent/Avoid: use protocol to ensure system NEVER enters deadlocked state'.
Which characteristic is typical of the 'Detect/Recover' approach to handling deadlocks?,It prevents deadlocks by constraining resource requests.,It relies on advance information about resource needs.,It allows the system to enter a deadlocked state before acting.,It is primarily used in general-purpose operating systems like Linux.,"It ignores the problem altogether, assuming deadlocks are rare.",C,"The text specifies that 'Detect/Recover' allows the system to enter a deadlocked state, then detect and recover."
In which type of system are 'Detect/Recover' methods for deadlocks explicitly mentioned as being used?,General-purpose operating systems like Linux,Embedded systems with limited resources,Database systems,Real-time operating systems,Gaming consoles,C,"The text states 'some systems, e.g., databases' use the Detect/Recover approach."
"For an optimal solution, the text suggests that basic deadlock handling approaches can be combined in what manner?",Eliminated in favor of a single universal method.,Applied only to critical system resources.,Per resource class.,Replaced by hardware-level deadlock prevention.,Ignored if system performance is satisfactory.,C,The text states 'Basic approaches can be combined for optimal solution per resource class'.
What is the defining characteristic of 'deadlock prevention' according to the text and glossary?,OS method where processes inform OS of resource use to approve/deny requests.,Methods to ensure at least one necessary condition for deadlock cannot hold.,Allowing the system to enter a deadlocked state and then recovering.,Ignoring the possibility of deadlocks due to their infrequency.,Detecting deadlocks by examining the system state periodically.,B,Both the Deadlock Prevention section and the glossary define it as 'Methods to ensure at least one necessary condition for deadlock cannot hold'.
Deadlock Prevention achieves its goal primarily by doing what?,Allowing threads to request resources freely and then checking for cycles.,By scheduling threads based on their estimated resource usage patterns.,By constraining resource request methods.,By periodically reallocating all system resources.,By rolling back transactions when a potential deadlock is detected.,C,The text states Deadlock Prevention 'Prevents deadlocks by constraining resource request methods'.
What information does the OS require in advance for Deadlock Avoidance to work effectively?,The current CPU utilization and memory availability.,Advance info on resources a thread will request/use.,The history of all past resource allocations.,User preferences for resource allocation policies.,The network traffic patterns of all active processes.,B,"The text explicitly states for Deadlock Avoidance, 'OS given advance info on resources a thread will request/use'."
"When implementing Deadlock Avoidance, which factors does the OS consider to decide whether to satisfy or delay a resource request?",Only the priority level of the requesting thread.,Only the total number of resources available in the system.,"Currently available resources, resources allocated to each thread, and future requests/releases of each thread.",The historical average of resource usage by similar threads.,User feedback and system administrator preferences.,C,"The text lists 'Currently available resources', 'Resources allocated to each thread', and 'Future requests/releases of each thread' as factors the OS considers."
"As defined in the section glossary, what is 'deadlock avoidance'?",A method where the OS ignores deadlocks due to their rarity.,OS method where processes inform OS of resource use; system approves/denies requests to avoid deadlock.,An approach that focuses on detecting deadlocks after they occur and then recovering.,A technique that ensures no single necessary condition for deadlock can hold.,A strategy that relies on manual restart to resolve deadlock situations.,B,The glossary defines 'deadlock avoidance' as 'OS method where processes inform OS of resource use; system approves/denies requests to avoid deadlock'.
Under what condition is the Deadlock Detection and Recovery approach typically used?,When system resources are unlimited.,Only in embedded systems.,If no prevention or avoidance methods are employed.,As the first line of defense against all types of system failures.,In real-time systems where any delay is unacceptable.,C,"The text states 'If no prevention/avoidance, deadlock may arise,' implying detection and recovery are used in such cases."
What are the two primary functionalities provided by algorithms in a system using Deadlock Detection and Recovery?,Prevent new requests and enforce resource order.,Examine system state to determine if deadlock occurred and recover from deadlock.,Predict future resource needs and delay requests.,Isolate affected threads and restart them individually.,Log all resource accesses and generate warning alerts.,B,The text states the system provides algorithms to 'Examine system state to determine if deadlock occurred' and 'Recover from deadlock'.
What happens if a deadlock remains undetected in a system?,The system automatically reboots and resolves the issue.,System performance improves due to fewer resource conflicts.,"System performance deteriorates, resources remain held, more threads deadlock, eventually requiring a manual restart.",The operating system automatically adjusts resource allocation to break the deadlock.,"A temporary pause in operations occurs, followed by self-correction.",C,"The text states 'Undetected deadlock: system performance deteriorates, resources held, more threads deadlock. Eventually, manual restart needed'."
"For what other type of failure might manual recovery, similar to that for deadlocks, be used?",Hardware failures.,Software bugs causing crashes.,"Liveness failures (e.g., livelock).",Memory leaks.,Network connectivity issues.,C,"The text mentions 'Manual recovery for other liveness failures (e.g., livelock) may be used for deadlock recovery'."
