"When selecting a victim for deadlock termination, 'computation time' is a factor. What specific aspects of computation time are considered?",Only the remaining time until the process completes.,Only the time the process has already spent computing.,How long the process has computed and how much longer it needs to complete.,The CPU cycles consumed per instruction.,The maximum allowed computation time for the process.,C,"The text specifies 'Computation time (how long computed, how much longer)' as a factor for victim selection."
"In the context of choosing a victim process for deadlock recovery, which aspect of 'resources used' is a relevant factor?",The monetary value of the resources held.,The number of files the process has opened.,The types of resources used and their ease of preemption.,Whether the resources are physical or virtual.,The total capacity of all resources held.,C,"The text lists 'Resources used (types, ease of preemption)' as a factor for choosing a victim."
What is the primary objective when selecting a victim process for termination in deadlock recovery?,To choose the process that has consumed the most CPU time.,To ensure that all processes get an equal chance to be terminated.,To minimize the overall cost associated with the termination.,To terminate the process with the lowest security clearance.,To randomly select a process to ensure fairness.,C,The text states that factors for choosing a victim are aimed at achieving 'minimum cost'.
How does resource preemption typically resolve a deadlock?,By forcing processes to request all their resources at once.,By preventing new resource requests from being made.,By successively taking resources from processes and reassigning them to others until the deadlock is broken.,By rolling back the entire system to a previous state.,"By allocating additional, redundant resources to all processes.",C,"Resource preemption involves 'Successively preempt resources from processes, give to others until deadlock broken'."
Which of the following is NOT one of the three core issues associated with resource preemption as a deadlock recovery method?,Selecting a victim,Rollback,Starvation,Resource discovery,All of the above are issues,D,"The three issues listed are 'Selecting a victim', 'Rollback', and 'Starvation'.

"After a process has its resources preempted, what action is typically taken regarding that process?","It is allowed to continue execution, ignoring the missing resource.",It is automatically restarted from the beginning without any state preservation.,It is rolled back to a safe state and then restarted.,It is immediately terminated without further action.,It is placed into a suspended state until the resource becomes available again.,C,"The text states that a preempted process 'Cannot continue normal execution (missing resource). Roll back to safe state, restart'."
Which type of rollback is described as the 'simplest' method when resources are preempted from a process?,Rolling back only the specific operations affected by the preemption.,"Total rollback, which involves aborting the process and restarting it.",Implementing frequent checkpoints to restore to a very recent state.,A partial rollback that leaves some operations incomplete.,Manually re-entering data after the process is restarted.,B,"The text defines the 'Simplest' rollback as 'total rollback (abort, restart)'."
"What characterizes the 'more effective' method of rollback, as opposed to the simplest method?",It performs a full system reboot.,It rolls back only as necessary and requires more state information.,It does not require any state information.,It only works for processes with very low priority.,It involves manual intervention for every rollback operation.,B,The text describes the 'More effective' rollback as 'roll back only as necessary (requires more state info)'.
"In the context of resource preemption, what does the issue of 'Starvation' refer to?",A situation where the system runs out of physical memory.,A condition where a process never completes because its resources are repeatedly preempted.,The inability of a process to acquire any resources due to high demand.,A scenario where the operating system itself runs low on critical resources.,The continuous failure of resource allocation algorithms.,B,Starvation is described as when a 'Process never completes' due to being repeatedly picked as a victim for resource preemption.
How can starvation be prevented in a system where resource preemption is used for deadlock recovery?,By ensuring a process is picked as a victim an infinite number of times.,By always selecting the same process as the victim.,By ensuring a process is picked as a victim a finite number of times.,By increasing the priority of the victim process to infinity.,By never preempting resources from any process.,C,"To prevent starvation, the system must 'Ensure process picked as victim finite number of times'."
