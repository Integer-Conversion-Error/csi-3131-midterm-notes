Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Answer,Explanation
Which statement accurately defines a deadlock?,A set of processes where each process is waiting for an event caused by another process within the same set.,"A state where a single process is infinitely looping, consuming all CPU resources.",An error where a program crashes due to insufficient memory.,A condition where all processes complete their execution simultaneously.,The rapid execution of multiple processes on a multi-core system.,A,"A deadlock is specifically defined as a situation where a set of processes are all blocked, each waiting for a resource or event held by another process in that same set."
How many necessary conditions must be present for a deadlock to occur?,One,Two,Three,Four,Five,D,The text explicitly states 'Four necessary conditions for deadlock'.
Which of the following is NOT one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock?,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,Resource preemption,Circular wait,No preemption,C,"The four necessary conditions are Mutual exclusion, Hold and wait, No preemption, and Circular wait. 'Resource preemption' is the opposite of 'No preemption' and would prevent deadlock, not cause it."
The 'mutual exclusion' condition for deadlock implies that:,Processes must share resources simultaneously.,Only one process at a time can use a resource.,Resources can be accessed by multiple processes concurrently.,Processes can enter a critical section without acquiring a lock.,All resources are always available to all processes.,B,"Mutual exclusion means that at least one resource involved must be non-sharable, allowing only one process to use it at a time."
The 'hold and wait' condition for deadlock describes a situation where a process:,Requests all its resources at the beginning of execution.,Releases all held resources before requesting new ones.,Holds at least one resource and is waiting to acquire additional resources held by other processes.,Waits for a specific event to occur before acquiring any resources.,Immediately releases resources as soon as it finishes using them.,C,Hold and wait means a process is holding onto at least one resource while waiting to acquire additional resources that are currently held by other processes.
The 'no preemption' condition for deadlock means that:,Resources can be forcibly taken away from a process.,"A resource can be released only voluntarily by the process holding it, after that process has completed its task.",Processes must preempt other processes to acquire resources.,All resources are preemptable.,Processes can always take resources from other processes if needed.,B,No preemption implies that resources cannot be forcibly taken away; they must be voluntarily released by the process holding them.
The 'circular wait' condition for deadlock means there exists a:,Linear sequence of processes where each process waits for the next.,"Set of processes P0, P1, ..., Pn such that P0 is waiting for a resource held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, ..., and Pn is waiting for a resource held by P0.",Process that continuously allocates and deallocates the same resource.,Situation where processes are not allowed to wait for resources.,Hierarchy of resource allocation that prevents any cycles.,B,"Circular wait means there's a closed chain of processes where each process in the chain is waiting for a resource held by the next process in the chain, with the last process waiting for a resource held by the first."
"For a deadlock to be possible, which of the following must be true regarding the four necessary conditions?",At least one of the conditions must be present.,Any two of the conditions must be present.,Exactly three of the conditions must be present.,All four conditions must be present simultaneously.,None of the conditions should be present.,D,The text states that 'Deadlock only possible if all four conditions present'.
What tool is typically used to model deadlocks in a system?,Flowcharts,Gantt charts,Resource-allocation graphs,State transition diagrams,Petri nets,C,The text specifies that 'Deadlocks modeled with resource-allocation graphs'.
"In a resource-allocation graph, what visually indicates the presence of a deadlock?",A straight line connecting two processes.,An isolated process node.,A cycle in the graph.,An absence of edges between nodes.,All resources pointing to a single process.,C,"The text states that in resource-allocation graphs, a 'cycle indicates deadlock'."
The primary goal of deadlock prevention strategies is to:,Allow deadlocks to occur and then recover from them.,Detect deadlocks after they have happened.,Ensure that at least one of the four necessary conditions for deadlock cannot hold.,Grant resources liberally to all processes.,Identify unsafe states in resource allocation.,C,"Deadlock prevention aims to 'ensure one of four conditions cannot occur', thereby making deadlocks impossible."
Which of the four necessary conditions for deadlock is most commonly targeted for elimination in practical deadlock prevention?,Mutual exclusion,Hold and wait,No preemption,Circular wait,Resource starvation,D,The text notes that 'Practical prevention: eliminate circular wait'. Eliminating the other conditions can be impractical or lead to poor resource utilization.
Which algorithm is typically employed for deadlock avoidance?,Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm,Round-robin algorithm,Banker's algorithm,FIFO scheduling algorithm,LRU replacement algorithm,C,The text explicitly states that 'Deadlock avoidance: use banker's algorithm'.
What is the core principle behind deadlock avoidance regarding resource granting?,Always grant resources immediately upon request.,Grant resources only if the system remains in a safe state.,Grant resources only to processes with the highest priority.,Never grant resources if any process is currently waiting.,"Grant resources on a first-come, first-served basis without checking safety.",B,"Deadlock avoidance strategy is to 'don't grant resources if leads to unsafe state', implying resources are granted only if it maintains a safe state."
What is the main function of a deadlock detection algorithm?,To prevent deadlocks from ever occurring.,To ensure that resource requests are always granted.,To evaluate the current state of processes and resources on a running system to identify if a deadlocked state exists.,To automatically recover from any system crashes.,To predict future resource needs of processes.,C,Deadlock detection involves an 'algorithm evaluates processes/resources on running system to find deadlocked state'.
One strategy for deadlock recovery involves:,Waiting indefinitely for the deadlock to resolve itself.,Aborting one or more processes involved in the circular wait.,Increasing the system's memory allocation.,Adding more CPUs to the system.,Ignoring the deadlock and hoping it disappears.,B,One recovery strategy is to 'Abort one process in circular wait'.
Another method for deadlock recovery involves:,Requesting the user to manually release resources.,Automatically granting all pending resource requests.,Preempting (taking away) resources that have been assigned to deadlocked processes.,Suspending all processes in the system.,Restarting the entire operating system.,C,Another recovery strategy is to 'Preempt resources assigned to deadlocked process'.
A deadlock is fundamentally characterized by processes that are:,Actively competing for CPU time.,Rapidly completing their tasks.,Stalled and waiting for each other indefinitely.,Cooperating to share resources efficiently.,Failing to start due to missing executable files.,C,"The definition highlights that processes in a deadlock are 'each waiting for event caused by another process in set', implying they are stalled indefinitely."
The key difference between deadlock prevention and deadlock avoidance is that:,"Prevention ensures conditions *cannot* occur, while avoidance *doesn't grant* resources if it leads to an unsafe state.","Prevention uses the Banker's Algorithm, while avoidance eliminates circular wait.","Prevention only applies to single-resource systems, while avoidance applies to multi-resource systems.","Prevention is reactive, while avoidance is proactive.","Prevention is about detecting, while avoidance is about recovering.",A,"Prevention aims to 'ensure one of four conditions cannot occur', making deadlocks impossible by design. Avoidance is a dynamic approach that 'don't grant resources if leads to unsafe state', always trying to keep the system in a safe state."
Which two actions are listed as primary strategies for deadlock recovery?,Implementing the Banker's algorithm and eliminating circular wait.,Modeling with resource-allocation graphs and ensuring mutual exclusion.,Aborting a process in circular wait and preempting resources from deadlocked processes.,Detecting deadlocked states and preventing hold-and-wait conditions.,Allowing preemption and ensuring all four conditions are met.,C,The text lists 'Abort one process in circular wait' and 'Preempt resources assigned to deadlocked process' as recovery methods.
