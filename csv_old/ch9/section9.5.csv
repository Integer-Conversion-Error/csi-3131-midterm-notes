"Instead of swapping entire processes, what variation do most contemporary systems like Linux and Windows use?",They completely disable swapping.,They swap only the kernel space.,They swap individual pages of a process.,They move processes directly to archival storage.,"They only swap process metadata, not the data itself.",C,"The text notes: 'Most systems (Linux, Windows) use variation: pages of a process swapped, not entire process.'"
"In the context of modern OS, when the text refers to 'swapping' without further qualification, what does it generally imply?",The movement of individual pages.,The transfer of application state to flash memory.,Standard swapping of entire processes.,The process of moving data between CPU caches.,The act of changing CPU cores.,C,The text clarifies: 'Term swapping now generally refers to standard swapping.'
"When referring to 'swapping with paging' in modern systems, what term is commonly used?",Context switching.,Migration.,Paging.,Hibernation.,Relocation.,C,The text states: 'Paging refers to swapping with paging.'
What is the process known as 'page out'?,Moving a page from backing store to memory.,Moving an entire process from memory to backing store.,Moving a page from memory to backing store.,Copying a page within main memory.,Deleting a page from the system.,C,The text defines: 'Page out: moves page from memory to backing store.'
