Question,Option A,Option B,Option C,Option D,Option E,Correct Answer,Explanation
A deadlock occurs when ____.,a process is waiting for I/O to a device that does not exist,the system has no available free resources,every process in a set is waiting for an event that can only be caused by another process in the set,,,C,"If all processes in the set are blocked from proceeding, then it is not possible for any process in the set to trigger the event (such as releasing a resource) that would break the deadlock."
Processes can wait while _______ a resource.,requesting,using,releasing,,,A,A process will wait requesting to acquire a resource that is currently in use by another process.
"The code example below _________ lead to deadlock between two threads.
/* thread_one runs in this function */
void *do_work_one(void *param)
{
   pthread_mutex_lock(&first_mutex);
   pthread_mutex_lock(&second_mutex);
   /**
     * Do some work
     */
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&second_mutex);
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&first_mutex);
 
   pthread_exit(0);
}
 
/* thread_two runs in this function */
void *do_work_two(void *param)
{
   pthread_mutex_lock(&second_mutex);
   pthread_mutex_lock(&first_mutex);
   /**
    * Do some work
    */
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&first_mutex);
   pthread_mutex_unlock(&second_mutex);
 
   pthread_exit(0);
}",will not,can,will,,,B,"Deadlock can, for example, occur in that ordering: (1) thread one acquires first_mutex, (2) thread_two acquires second_mutex."
The four necessary conditions of deadlock must be present for deadlock to occur.,True,False,,,,A,"If any one of the four necessary conditions is not present in a system, deadlock cannot occur."
"One necessary condition for deadlock is ____, which states that a process must be holding one resource and waiting to acquire additional resources.",hold and wait,mutual exclusion,no preemption,,,A,The hold and wait condition is necessary for deadlock as a waiting thread can make no further progress to eventually break the deadlock condition.
The presence of a cycle in a resource-allocation graph is ____.,a necessary and sufficient condition for deadlock in the case that each resource has more than one instance,a necessary and sufficient condition for a deadlock in the case that each resource has exactly one instance,is neither necessary nor sufficient for indicating deadlock in the case that each resource has exactly one instance,,,B,"In a system where each resource has exactly one resource, a cycle in the resource allocation graph indicates deadlock as there is a circular wait among the set of deadlocked processes which does not allow any process to release a resource and thereby break the cycle."
"If a resource-allocation graph has a cycle, the system must be in a deadlock.",True,False,,,,B,The presence of a cycle indicates deadlock only when there is a single instance of each resource type.
"To handle deadlocks, operating systems most often ____.",ignore the problem of deadlocks,use protocols to prevent or avoid deadlocks,detect and recover from deadlocks,,,A,Operating systems generally do not handle deadlocks and instead leave it up to application developers to design applications that handle deadlocks.
Deadlock _______ handles deadlocks by ensuring that one of their necessary conditions cannot hold.,avoidance,prevention,recovery,,,B,Deadlock prevention manages deadlock by invalidating one of the necessary conditions required for deadlock to be present in a system.
Deadlock prevention by denying the _________ condition is the simplest way to prevent deadlocks.,mutual exclusion,no preemption,circular wait,,,C,This is the most straight-forward way of preventing deadlocks as it simply requires processes to acquire resources in a defined order.

"In general, using virtual memory technology decreases the degree of multiprogramming in a system.",True,False,,,,B,"With virtual memory technology, a process does not need to use all of its physical memory at any given time, which frees up memory that can be allocated to other processes."
Referencing a page that is not yet loaded in main memory is known as __________ .,demand paging,a page fault,a trap,,,B,A page fault occurs when a page that is absent in memory is referenced.
Handling a page fault requires __________ .,setting the valid/invalid bit to valid,requires checking the value of the valid/invalid bit,bringing the page from the backing store and storing it in a frame in physical memory,,,C,A page fault indicates a referenced page is absent in physical memory. The operating system handles the page fault by loading the page into a free frame in physical memory.
"On a system with demand-paging, a process will experience a high page fault rate when the process begins execution.",True,False,,,,A,"With demand paging, each page is loaded into physical memory when it is first referenced. When a process begins running, it is referencing most pages for the first time and therefore will initially have a high page fault rate."

A process's locality can change which means the working set will also change over time."
What best describes the relationship between the working set and page fault rate of a process?,The page fault rate is independent of the working set.,"Once the working set of a process is in memory, the page fault rate will be low.",The larger the working set the higher the page fault rate.,,,B,"When a process moves from one working set to another (the process has changed its locality), the page fault rate will initially increase as the new page references must first be brought into memory. Once the working set of a process is in memory, the page fault rate of the process will decrease until the process moves to another working set."
What must occur if a compressed frame is referenced?,The contents of the compressed frame must be accessed.,The frame must be decompressed and moved to a free frame.,,,,B,Accessing a compressed frame is treated as a page fault and the compressed frame must first be decompressed and moved to a free frame before it can be accessed.

As the disk head is currently at cylinder 88 and moving upwards, the requests will be serviced in the order 100 - 116 - 185. When the disk arm reaches the end of the disk, it will begin servicing requests in the opposite order, 87 - 75 - 22 - 11 - 3."
