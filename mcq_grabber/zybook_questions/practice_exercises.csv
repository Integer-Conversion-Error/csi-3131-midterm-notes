"A possible method for preventing deadlocks is to have a single, higher-order resource that must be requested before any other resource. For example, if multiple threads attempt to access the synchronization objects
A
⋯
E
, deadlock is possible. (Such synchronization objects may include mutexes, semaphores, condition variables, and the like.) We can prevent deadlock by adding a sixth object
F
. Whenever a thread wants to acquire the synchronization lock for any object
A
⋯
E
, it must first acquire the lock for object
F
. This solution is known as containment: the locks for objects
A
⋯
E
are contained within the lock for object
F
. Compare this scheme with the circular-wait scheme of Section Circular wait.",

"Consider a computer system that runs 5,000 jobs per month and has no deadlock-prevention or deadlock-avoidance scheme. Deadlocks occur about twice per month, and the operator must terminate and rerun about ten jobs per deadlock. Each job is worth about two dollars (in CPU time), and the jobs terminated tend to be about half done when they are aborted.

A systems programmer has estimated that a deadlock-avoidance algorithm (like the banker's algorithm) could be installed in the system with an increase of about 10 percent in the average execution time per job. Since the machine currently has 30 percent idle time, all 5,000 jobs per month could still be run, although turnaround time would increase by about 20 percent on average.

What are the arguments for installing the deadlock-avoidance algorithm?
What are the arguments against installing the deadlock-avoidance algorithm?",

"Suppose that you have coded the deadlock-avoidance safety algorithm that determines if a system is in a safe state or not, and now have been asked to implement the deadlock-detection algorithm. Can you do so by simply using the safety algorithm code and redefining Maxi = Waitingi + Allocationi, where Waitingi is a vector specifying the resources for which thread
i
is waiting and Allocationi is as defined in Section 8.6? Explain your answer.",
Is it possible to have a deadlock involving only one single-threaded process? Explain your answer.,
Name two differences between logical and physical addresses.,
Why are page sizes always powers of 2?,
"Consider a system in which a program can be separated into two parts: code and data. The CPU knows whether it wants an instruction (instruction fetch) or data (data fetch or store). Therefore, two base-limit register pairs are provided: one for instructions and one for data. The instruction base-limit register pair is automatically read-only, so programs can be shared among different users. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this scheme.",

"An operating system supports a paged virtual memory. The central processor has a cycle time of 1 microsecond. It costs an additional 1 microsecond to access a page other than the current one. Pages have 1,000 words, and the paging device is a drum that rotates at 3,000 revolutions per minute and transfers 1 million words per second. The following statistical measurements were obtained from the system:

One percent of all instructions executed accessed a page other than the current page.
Of the instructions that accessed another page, 80 percent accessed a page already in memory.
When a new page was required, the replaced page was modified 50 percent of the time.

Calculate the effective instruction time on this system, assuming that the system is running one process only and that the processor is idle during drum transfers.",
