% \subsection*{1 Single-processor systems}
% \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1 Single-processor systems}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Definition:} One general-purpose CPU with a single processing core.
%     \item Historically common, but few contemporary systems fit this.
%     \item \textbf{CPU Core:} Executes instructions, contains registers for local data.
%     \item Main CPU core executes general-purpose instruction sets (including processes).
%     \item May include \textbf{special-purpose processors} (e.g., disk, keyboard, graphics controllers).
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Run limited instruction sets; do not run processes.
%         \item Can be OS-managed (OS sends tasks, monitors status).
%         \item Example: Disk-controller microprocessor handles disk queue/scheduling, reducing main CPU overhead.
%         \item Example: Keyboard microprocessor converts keystrokes to codes for CPU.
%         \item Can be low-level hardware components, operating autonomously without OS communication.
%     \end{itemize}

% \subsection*{2 Multiprocessor systems}
% \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2 Multiprocessor systems}
% \begin{itemize}
% %    \item Dominant in modern computing (mobile devices to servers).
% %    \item Traditionally: Two or more processors, each with a single-core CPU.
% %    \item Share computer bus, sometimes clock, memory, and peripheral devices.
% %    \item \textbf{Primary advantage:} Increased throughput (more work in less time).
% %    \item Speed-up ratio with $N$ processors is less than $N$ due to overhead and contention for shared resources.
% %    \item \textbf{Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP):}
% %    \begin{itemize}
% %        \item Each peer CPU processor performs all tasks (OS functions, user processes).
% %        \item Each CPU has its own registers and private/local cache.
% %        \item All processors share physical memory via the system bus.
% %        \item \textit{Figure 1.3.1: Symmetric multiprocessing architecture. Diagram shows main memory connected to two processors, each with its own CPU containing registers and cache.}
% %        \item Benefit: $N$ processes can run simultaneously on $N$ CPUs without significant performance degradation.
% %        \item Inefficiencies from idle/overloaded CPUs mitigated by sharing data structures.
% %        \item Allows dynamic sharing of processes and resources (e.g., memory) among processors, reducing workload variance.
% %        \item Requires careful design (e.g., CPU Scheduling, Synchronization Tools).
% %    \end{itemize}
% %    \item \textbf{Multicore systems:}
% %    \begin{itemize}
% %        \item Modern evolution: Multiple computing cores on a single chip.
% %        \item More efficient than multiple single-core chips due to faster on-chip communication.
% %        \item Uses significantly less power than multiple single-core chips (critical for mobile/laptops).
% %        \item Example: Dual-core design (Figure 1.3.2)
% %        \begin{itemize}
% %            \item Each core has its own register set and L1 cache.
% %            \item Shared L2 cache is local to the chip.
% %            \item Combines local (smaller, faster) and shared (higher-level) caches.
% %        \end{itemize}
% %        \item \textit{Figure 1.3.2: A dual-core design with two cores on the same chip. Diagram shows main memory connected to L2 cache of processor. Processor has two CPU cores, each core has its own registers and L1 cache and shares L2 cache of processor.}
% %        \item An $N$-core processor appears as $N$ standard CPUs to the OS.
% %        \item Demands efficient use of processing cores from OS/application designers (Threads \& Concurrency).
% %        \item Supported by virtually all modern OS (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS).
% %    \end{itemize}
%     \item \% Content commented out for debugging
% \end{itemize}
% \subsubsection*{Definitions of computer system components}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{CPU:} Hardware that executes instructions.
%     \item \textbf{Processor:} A physical chip containing one or more CPUs.
%     \item \textbf{Core:} Basic computation unit of the CPU.
%     \item \textbf{Multicore:} Multiple computing cores on the same CPU.
%     \item \textbf{Multiprocessor:} Multiple processors within the same CPU chip or system.
% \end{itemize}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item General term \textit{CPU} refers to a single computational unit.
%     \item \textit{Core} and \textit{multicore} refer specifically to one or more cores on a CPU.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsubsection*{Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA)}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Alternative to scaling multiprocessor systems when bus contention is a bottleneck.
%     \item Each CPU (or group of CPUs) has its own \textbf{local memory} via a small, fast local bus.
%     \item CPUs connected by a \textbf{shared system interconnect}; all CPUs share one physical address space.
%     \item \textit{Figure 1.3.3: NUMA multiprocessing architecture. Diagram shows NUMA architecture which includes four interconnected CPUs, each attached with its own local memory.}
%     \item \textbf{Advantage:} Fast local memory access with no contention over system interconnect.
%     \item \textbf{Result:} NUMA systems scale more effectively with additional processors.
%     \item \textbf{Potential drawback:} Increased latency for remote memory access across system interconnect (e.g., $CPU0$ accessing $CPU3$'s local memory is slower).
%     \item OS minimizes NUMA penalty via careful CPU scheduling and memory management.
%     \item Increasingly popular on servers and high-performance computing systems due to scalability.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsubsection*{Blade servers}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Multiple processor boards, I/O boards, and networking boards in same chassis.
%     \item Differ from traditional multiprocessor systems: each blade-processor board boots independently and runs its own OS.
%     \item Can consist of multiple independent multiprocessor systems.
% \end{itemize}
% 
% \subsection*{3 Clustered systems}
% \addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3 Clustered systems}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Another type of multiprocessor system, gathering multiple CPUs.
%     \item Composed of two or more individual systems (\textbf{nodes}) joined together; each node typically a multicore system.
%     \item Considered \textbf{loosely coupled}.
%     \item Definition: Clustered computers share storage and are closely linked via LAN or faster interconnect (e.g., InfiniBand).
%     \item \textbf{Primary use:} Provide \textbf{high-availability service} (service continues even if one or more systems fail).
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Achieved by adding redundancy.
%         \item Cluster software runs on nodes; each node monitors others.
%         \item If a monitored machine fails, monitoring machine takes ownership of its storage and restarts applications.
%         \item Users/clients experience only a brief interruption.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item High availability increases reliability.
%     \item \textbf{Graceful degradation:} System's ability to continue providing service proportional to surviving hardware.
%     \item \textbf{Fault-tolerant systems:} Can suffer a single component failure and continue operation (requires detection, diagnosis, correction).
%     \item \textbf{Clustering structures:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Asymmetric clustering:} One machine in \textbf{hot-standby mode} (monitors active server); if active fails, hot-standby becomes active.
%         \item \textbf{Symmetric clustering:} Two or more hosts run applications and monitor each other; more efficient as it uses all hardware, but requires multiple applications.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{PC motherboard example:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Fully functioning computer once slots populated (processor socket, DRAM sockets, PCIe bus slots, I/O connectors).
%         \item Lowest-cost general-purpose CPUs have multiple cores.
%         \item Some motherboards have multiple processor sockets (for NUMA systems).
%         \item \textit{Image shows a computer processor with arrows pointing to: DRAM slots, processor socket, PCI bus slots, and various I/O and power connectors.}
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item Clusters provide significantly greater computational power than single-processor/SMP systems.
%         \item Run applications concurrently on all computers in the cluster.
%         \item Requires applications specifically written for clusters (e.g., \textbf{parallelization}).
%         \item \textbf{Parallelization:} Divides a program into separate components that run in parallel on individual cores/computers.
%         \item Results from nodes combined into a final solution.
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Other cluster forms:}
%     \begin{itemize}
%         \item \textbf{Parallel clusters:} Multiple hosts access same data on shared storage.
%         \item Often requires special software/application releases (e.g., Oracle Real Application Cluster).
%         \item Uses \textbf{distributed lock manager (DLM)} for access control and locking.
%         \item Clustering over Wide-Area Network (WAN).
%     \end{itemize}
%     \item Cluster technology rapidly evolving (supporting thousands of systems, separated by miles).
%     \item Enabled by \textbf{Storage-Area Networks (SANs)}: allow many systems to attach to a pool of storage.
%     \item If applications/data on SAN, cluster software can assign application to any host attached to SAN.
%     \item \textit{Figure 1.3.4: General structure of a clustered system. Diagram shows structure of clustered system in which storage-area network is connected with set of interconnected computers.}

\subsection*{4 Dual-mode and Multimode Operation}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{4 Dual-mode and Multimode Operation}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Ensures incorrect/malicious programs don't harm others or OS.
    \item Distinguishes OS code execution from user code.
    \item Hardware supports differentiation among execution modes.
    \item At least two separate modes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{User mode}: System executing for user application.
        \item \textbf{Kernel mode} (also \textbf{supervisor mode}, \textbf{system mode}, or \textbf{privileged mode}): System executing for OS.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mode bit} added to hardware: kernel (0) or user (1).
    \item \textit{Figure 1.4.2: Transition from user to kernel mode. Diagram shows events such as user process executing, calling system call and return from system call in user mode whereas trapping mode bit 0, execute system call, and returning mode bit 1 in kernel mode.}
    \item At boot, hardware starts in kernel mode.
    \item OS loaded, starts user applications in user mode.
    \item Trap or interrupt: hardware switches from user to kernel mode (mode bit to 0).
    \item OS always gains control in kernel mode.
    \item System switches to user mode (mode bit to 1) before passing control to user program.
    \item \textit{Figure 1.4.3: Windows Performance Monitor tool. Image shows a graph which utilizes an x-axis with time and y-axis with percentages of system usage. It shows in green the user mode which is higher than the red line which is in kernel mode.}
    \item Dual mode protects OS from errant users, and users from each other.
    \item \textbf{Privileged instructions}: Harmful machine instructions, executable only in kernel mode.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Attempt in user mode $\rightarrow$ hardware treats as illegal, traps to OS.
        \item Examples: switch to kernel mode, I/O control, timer management, interrupt management.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Modes can extend beyond two:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intel processors: four \textbf{protection rings} (ring 0 kernel, ring 3 user).
        \item ARM v8 systems: seven modes.
        \item CPUs supporting virtualization: separate mode for \textbf{Virtual Machine Manager (VMM)}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Instruction execution lifecycle: OS (kernel) $\rightarrow$ user app (user) $\rightarrow$ back to OS via interrupt, trap, or system call.
    \item Most contemporary OS (Windows, Unix, Linux) use dual-mode for protection.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{System Calls}
\begin{itemize}
    \item User program asks OS to perform reserved tasks.
    \item Invoked via trap to specific interrupt vector location.
    \item Can use generic `trap` or specific `syscall` instruction.
    \item Hardware treats as software interrupt.
    \item Control passes to OS service routine; mode bit set to kernel.
    \item Kernel examines instruction, determines system call, verifies parameters, executes request, returns control.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Program Errors}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Hardware protection detects mode-violating errors (e.g., illegal instruction, invalid memory access).
    \item Hardware traps to OS.
    \item OS terminates program abnormally, provides error message, may dump memory for examination.

    \item Variable timer: fixed-rate clock and counter.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item OS sets counter.
        \item Every clock tick, counter decremented.
        \item Counter reaches 0, interrupt occurs.
    \end{itemize}
    \item OS ensures timer set before turning control to user.
    \item If timer interrupts, control transfers automatically to OS (may treat as fatal error or give more time).
    \item Instructions modifying timer content are privileged.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Linux timers}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Kernel config parameter \textbf{HZ} specifies timer interrupt frequency (e.g., 250 HZ = 250 interrupts/sec).
    \item Related kernel variable \textbf{jiffies} represents timer interrupts since boot.

\section*{1.9 Kernel data structures}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1.9 Kernel data structures}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Fundamental data structures used extensively in operating systems.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1 Lists, stacks, and queues}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1 Lists, stacks, and queues}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Array:} Simple data structure; each element accessed directly (e.g., main memory).
    \item \textbf{List:} Collection of data values as a sequence; items accessed in particular order.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Commonly implemented as a \textbf{linked list}, where items are linked.
        \item \textbf{Singly linked list:} Each item points to its successor.
        \item \textit{Figure 1.9.1: Singly linked list. Diagram shows a sequence of data sets where each data set points to its immediate successor, and the last data set points to null.}
        \item \textbf{Doubly linked list:} Item can refer to its predecessor or successor.
        \item \textit{Figure 1.9.2: Doubly linked list. Diagram shows a sequence of data sets where each data set points to its immediate successor and predecessor.}
        \item \textbf{Circularly linked list:} Last element refers to the first, not null.
        \item Accommodates varying item sizes; allows easy insertion/deletion.
        \item \textbf{Disadvantage:} Retrieving specified item is $O(N)$ in worst case (linear performance).
        \item Used directly by kernel algorithms or for constructing other structures.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Stack:} Sequentially ordered data structure using \textbf{Last In, First Out (LIFO)} principle.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Last item added is first removed.
        \item Operations: \textbf{push} (insert), \textbf{pop} (remove).
        \item OS uses stacks for function calls (parameters, local variables, return address pushed/popped).
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Queue:} Sequentially ordered data structure using \textbf{First In, First Out (FIFO)} principle.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Items removed in order of insertion.
        \item Common in OS (e.g., printer jobs, CPU scheduling tasks).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2 Trees}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2 Trees}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Data structure to represent data hierarchically via parent-child relationships.
    \item \textbf{General tree:} Parent may have unlimited children.
    \item \textbf{Binary tree:} Parent has at most two children (left and right).
    \item \textbf{Binary search tree:} Binary tree with ordering: \textit{left\_child} $\le$ \textit{right\_child}.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Figure 1.9.4: Binary search tree. Diagram shows a binary search tree with a root item 17, branching into 12 and 35. Item 12 branches into 6 and 14. Item 35 branches into 40, which then branches into 38.}
        \item Worst-case search performance is $O(N)$.
        \item \textbf{Balanced binary search tree:} Contains $N$ items with at most $\lg N$ levels, ensuring $O(\lg N)$ worst-case performance.
        \item \textbf{Example:} Linux uses a balanced binary search tree (red-black tree) for CPU scheduling.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3 Hash functions and maps}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3 Hash functions and maps}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hash function:} Takes data input, performs numeric operation, returns numeric value.
    \item Numeric value used as index into a table (array) for quick data retrieval.
    \item Retrieval can be $O(1)$ (constant time), much faster than $O(N)$ for lists.
    \item Used extensively in OS due to performance.
    \item \textbf{Hash collision:} Two unique inputs result in same output value (same table location).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Handled by having a linked list at the table location for all items with same hash value.
        \item More collisions reduce efficiency.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Hash map:} Associates (maps) [key:value] pairs using a hash function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Apply hash function to key to obtain value.
        \item \textit{Figure 1.9.5: Hash map. Diagram shows a hash map with bits numbered 0 to N. A hash function applied to a key on one bit of the hash map obtains a value.}
        \item \textbf{Example:} User name mapped to password for authentication.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{4 Bitmaps}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{4 Bitmaps}

    \item \textbf{Example:} 0 = resource available, 1 = resource unavailable.
    \item Value of $i^{th}$ position associated with $i^{th}$ resource.
    \item \textbf{Example bitmap:} `0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 1` (resources 2, 4, 5, 6, 8 unavailable; 0, 1, 3, 7 available).
    \item \textbf{Space efficiency:} Significant power; using single bit vs. eight-bit Boolean value saves space.
    \item Commonly used to represent availability of large number of resources (e.g., disk blocks).
\end{itemize}

\section*{1.11 Free and open-source operating systems}
\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{1.11 Free and open-source operating systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Study of OS made easier by free software and open-source releases.
    \item Both available in source-code format (not compiled binary).
    \item \textbf{Free software} (\textit{free/libre software}):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Source code available.
        \item Licensed for no-cost use, redistribution, and modification.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Open-source software}:

        \item Source code available.
        \item Does not necessarily offer free licensing.
    \end{itemize}
    \item All free software is open source, but some open-source software is not "free."
    \item \textbf{GNU/Linux:} Most famous open-source OS; some distributions are free, others open source only.
    \item \textbf{Microsoft Windows:} Closed-source, proprietary software (Microsoft owns, restricts use, protects source code).
    \item \textbf{Apple macOS:} Hybrid approach (open-source \textbf{Darwin} kernel, proprietary closed-source components).
    \item Starting with source code allows programmers to produce executable binary code.
    \item Examining source code is an excellent learning tool: students can modify, compile, and run changes.
    \item \textbf{Benefits of open-source operating systems:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Community of programmers contribute (write, debug, analyze, support, suggest changes).
        \item Arguably more secure (many eyes viewing the code).
        \item Bugs found and fixed faster due to number of users/viewers.
        \item Commercial companies (e.g., Red Hat) benefit from open-sourcing code (revenue from support contracts, hardware sales).
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{1 History}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{1 History}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Early computing (1950s): software generally came with source code (e.g., MIT's Tech Model Railroad Club, Homebrew user groups, DECUS).
    \item 1970: Digital's OS distributed as source code with no restrictions/copyright.
    \item Companies later limited software use to authorized/paying customers.
    \item Releasing only binary files (not source code) protected code/ideas.
    \item By 1980: proprietary software was usual case.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2 Free operating systems}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{2 Free operating systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item To counter proprietary trend, \textbf{Richard Stallman} (1984) started developing \textbf{GNU} ("GNU's Not Unix!"): a free, UNIX-compatible OS.
    \item "Free" refers to freedom of use, not price.
    \item Free-software movement holds users entitled to four freedoms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item To freely run the program.
        \item To study and change the source code.
        \item To give or sell copies.
        \item To give or sell copies with or without changes.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item 1985: Stallman published \textbf{GNU Manifesto} (argues all software should be free).
    \item Formed \textbf{Free Software Foundation (FSF)} to encourage free software use/development.
    \item FSF uses "copyleft" (Stallman invention): licensing giving four essential freedoms, conditioned on preserving them in redistribution.
    \item \textbf{GNU General Public License (GPL):} Common free software license; requires source code distribution with binaries, and all copies (modified) released under same GPL.
    \item Creative Commons "Attribution Sharealike" license is also a copyleft license.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{3 GNU/Linux}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{3 GNU/Linux}
\begin{itemize}
    \item By 1991: GNU OS nearly complete (compilers, editors, utilities, libraries, games), but kernel not ready.
    \item 1991: \textbf{Linus Torvalds} (Finland) released rudimentary UNIX-like kernel using GNU compilers/tools, invited worldwide contributions.
    \item Internet enabled rapid "Linux" growth (weekly updates, thousands of programmers).
    \item 1991: Linux not free (noncommercial redistribution only).
    \item 1992: Torvalds rereleased Linux under GPL, making it free software (and "open source").
    \item \textbf{GNU/Linux:} Full OS (kernel properly Linux, includes GNU tools).
    \item Spawned hundreds of unique \textbf{distributions} (custom builds): Red Hat, SUSE, Fedora, Debian, Slackware, Ubuntu.
    \item Distributions vary in function, utility, installed applications, hardware support, user interface, and purpose.
    \item Example: Red Hat Enterprise Linux for large commercial use.
    \item Example: \textbf{PCLinuxOS} is a \textbf{Live CD} (or \textbf{LiveDVD}) -- OS bootable/run from CD-ROM/DVD without installation.
    \item Running Linux on Windows (or other) system using virtualization:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Download/install free \textbf{Virtualbox VMM} tool (\url{https://www.virtualbox.org/}).
        \item Install OS from scratch (CD image) or use pre-built images (\url{http://virtualboxes.org/images/}).
        \item Boot the virtual machine within Virtualbox.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Alternative: free program \textbf{Qemu} (\url{http://wiki.qemu.org/Download/}), includes \texttt{qemu-img} for converting Virtualbox images.

    \item To explore FreeBSD source code: download VM image (Virtualbox), source in \texttt{/usr/src/}, kernel in \texttt{/usr/src/sys}, VM code in \texttt{/usr/src/sys/vm}.
    \item View source code online: \url{https://svnweb.freebsd.org}.
    \item Source code controlled by a \textbf{version control system} (e.g., "subversion" \url{https://subversion.apache.org/source-code}).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Allows user to "pull" entire source code tree and "push" changes.
        \item Provides file history and conflict resolution.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Another version control system: \textbf{git} (\url{http://www.git-scm.com}), used for GNU/Linux and other programs.
    \item \textbf{Darwin:} Core kernel component of macOS, based on BSD UNIX, open-sourced (\url{http://www.opensource.apple.com/}).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Every macOS release has open-source components posted there.
        \item Package containing kernel begins with "xnu."
        \item Apple provides developer tools, documentation, support (\url{http://developer.apple.com}).
    \end{itemize}

\subsection*{5 The study of operating systems}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{5 The study of operating systems}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Never been easier/more interesting to study OS.
    \item Open-source movement: many OS available in source and binary (Linux, BSD UNIX, Solaris, part of macOS).
    \item Source code allows studying OS from inside out (examining code vs. documentation/behavior).
    \item OS no longer commercially viable have been open-sourced (study how systems operated with fewer CPU, memory, storage resources).
    \item Rise of \textbf{virtualization} (mainstream, often free) allows running many OS on one core system.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Example: VMware (\url{http://www.vmware.com}) provides free "player" for Windows; hundreds of free "virtual appliances" can run.
        \item Example: Virtualbox (\url{http://www.virtualbox.com}) provides free, open-source VMM on many OS.
        \item Students can try hundreds of OS without dedicated hardware.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Simulators of specific hardware also available (run OS on "native" hardware within modern computer/OS).
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Example: DECSYSTEM-20 simulator on macOS can boot TOPS-20, load source tapes, modify/compile new TOPS-20 kernel.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Open-source OS make it easier to move from student to OS developer (create new OS distribution).
    \item Access to source code limited only by interest, time, and disk space.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{6 Solaris}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{6 Solaris}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Commercial UNIX-based OS of Sun Microsystems.
    \item Originally Sun's \textbf{SunOS} based on BSD UNIX.
    \item 1991: Sun moved to AT\&T's System V UNIX as its base.
    \item 2005: Sun open-sourced most Solaris code as the \textbf{OpenSolaris} project.
    \item 2010: Oracle's purchase of Sun left project state unclear.
    \item \textbf{Project Illumos:} Groups interested in OpenSolaris expanded features; basis for several products (\url{http://wiki.illumos.org}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{7 Open-source systems as learning tools}
\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{7 Open-source systems as learning tools}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Free-software movement drives programmers to create thousands of open-source projects (including OS).
    \item Portals: \url{http://freshmeat.net/}, \url{http://distrowatch.com/}.
    \item Students use source code as learning tool: modify/test programs, help find/fix bugs, explore mature systems (OS, compilers, tools, UIs).
    \item Availability of source code for historic projects (e.g., Multics) helps understanding and building knowledge for new projects.
    \item Diversity of open-source OS (e.g., GNU/Linux, BSD UNIX) with different goals, utility, licensing, purpose.
    \item Cross-pollination occurs (e.g., major OpenSolaris components ported to BSD UNIX), allowing rapid improvements.
    \item Advantages of free software and open sourcing likely to increase number/quality of open-source projects and their adoption.
\end{itemize}
